Logan rescues himself, finds William, tries to show him that this place is getting to his head, shows that William is in love with a fucking machine. Instead of being angry, he forgives him, unties him, offers a drink and says it's fine, this place can take over your head, and promises not to talk about what happened in this park, so he wouldn't ruin the relationship William has with his sister.

It's refreshing to see that this one *didn't.* Season one is a completely self-contained story from beginning to violently delightful end.\n\nIt feels so often with other shows that we're being fucked with. Cliffhanger after cliffhanger, like the producers are hoping the studios will green light season 2 if everyone is asking \"oh my god who's the father?!?\"\n\nWhen a show ends a season *without* a cliffhanger, it feels like we've been given real closure. It would have been so *easy* for Bernard to have asked Ford, \"what happened to Elsie and Stubbs?\" Or, \"what about the other parks?\" Or, \"Are *you* a host of yourself?\" so that *we* would feel like something was missing, but they didn't tease us with it. They gave us an honest-to-God ending with actual resolution of conflicts.\n\nIt doesn't *matter* if Charlotte survived. It doesn't *matter* if William survived, or if Logan and the horse are rowing Gendry's boat somewhere. And it doesn't matter one bit of Maeve finds her daughter, Elsie and Stubbs are alive, or Bernard becomes the new Park Director. \n\nThese things are so trivial compared to the scope of the conflict that just got resolved: Dolores has a *bicameral mind.* We just witnessed Creation: not in seven days, but in thirty years. \n\nSo I think it's worth it to thank the showrunners for not dangling a stupid cliffhanger in front of us. We got a complete story. And I'm grateful. \n\n\n**Edit: I'm being told by the detectives in this sub that the thing I said about the bicameral mind is wrong.** I hate being wrong on the internet, so I'm going to rewatch the whole thing to see what you're all talking about.

I also linked to some photos of my Oglala Lakota relatives (including my grandmother, great-grandmother and great-great grandmother and great-great grandfather).  My great grandmother (in attached article) was a survivor of the Wounded Knee massacre in South Dakota.  Her parents rescued an infant after the massacre, whom a quite sad book was written about (Lost Bird of Wounded Knee). I\u2019m part Oglala Lakota and grew up in Rapid City surrounded by the Lakota culture.\n\n\n**PHOTOS OF MY LAKOTA RELATIVES I AM MENTIONING: http://imgur.com/a/0zmcuSC**\n\n\nI felt the episode last night was absolutely beautiful, I was crying through about 95% of it. The previous depiction of the GN tribe left me feeling kinda uneasy, a lot of it was very stereotypical, but I had hope that this episode would be some redemption. I was totally right, and episode 8 was not only the best of the show so far (in my opinion), but once of the best episodes of any show I have seen.\n\n\nThe parts that struck me the most were the narrative style of the episode (traditional Lakota history was oral, everything was passed down via language, stories and drawings). I remember my grandmother had a gorgeous leather book called a winter count when I was a little girl. It had all these beautiful color paintings / drawings of events that happened throughout the tribe, including Haley's Comet.  I also remember seeing Lakota beadwork everywhere when I was a kid, some of which I still have.  \n\n\nI also loved the sense of community they showed within GN. I remember when I was little seeing Lakota elders stop by to visit my grandmother, sometimes totally unannounced, and they would just sit and visit and chat, sometimes speaking in Lakota.  There was a strong sense of community among the tribe, and everyone my grandmother\u2019s age seemed to know each other.  I wish I knew how incredible this was when I was a little girl, as it was a regular occurrence in my life.  My grandmother grew up on Pine Ridge, and was married on the reservation to a Scottish sailor who had fallen in love with her (my grandfather).  They then raised their family in Rapid City.  My grandfather\u2019s family shunned him when he married a Native American woman, but he didn\u2019t care and created a beautiful family of his own in South Dakota.\n\n\nBack to the episode: I also loved the fact that Akecheta was awake, and had almost a mystical quality to him, he was connected to something larger in this episode, and understood things on a higher level. It reminded me of my grandmother, she often would tell me stories that other people dismissed completely, but that I listened to, and the way she talked to me was similar to how Akecheta talked to Maeve\u2019s daughter \u2013 she talked to me like I was an adult, not a child.  \n\n\nI also noticed that they seem to be lining up GN to be the good guys to help take down deathbringer, which is nice to see since Native Americans are often treated as the bad guys.  The episode was profoundly brilliant and beautiful and the parallels to what has happened to Native Americans are strong.  I love that the GN seems to be positioned to embark on a new journey, and I hope the same for the Native American nations.\n\n\nOverall I felt like the episode was beautiful, and the Lakota language is sooo gorgeous, it was amazing to see them use it for the majority of the episode. \n\n\n\n\nBeautiful and amazing episode, I am in awe of the WW creators right now, absolutely incredible episode and a huge shoutout to Zahn McClarnon for an incredible, moving, beautiful and brilliant performance. \n\n**TLDR; episode was AMAZING!**\n\nEDIT: for formatting\n\nEDIT NO 2: Reddit gold!

We saw this episode that the massacre that Teddy remembers as Wyatt having committed was actually committed by Dolores. This leads to several conclusions, all of which support the tinfoils across this thread.\n\n1) There are 3 timelines (Present, 30 years ago, 35 years ago)\nI think it's fairly obvious at this point that we have had three timelines displayed to us. The first timeline, taking place ~35 years ago, is shown to us in the Dolores flashback this episode. The hosts are basic, and some hosts (like Maeve and Armistice) are only just being introduced to the fold are are going through basic programming. At a very minimum, this establishes an initial timeline, as directly pointed out by Dolores (\"when are we?\"), and as proven by the buried/open church distinction. Also, Teddy's flashbacks to the \"Wyatt massacre\" closely if not perfectly mirror Dolores flashback, but that'll be important later. In order to establish the third timeline, we need to prove that...\n\n2) William = MiB\nThis has been popular since the beginning, and I think it's spelled out for the viewers at this point that William and the Man in Black are one and the same, establishing a distinction between the present and 30 years ago. There's thematic evidence behind it, such as the mirroring of William and the MiB in their picking up of Dolores's can, thinking of the park as a story that they have to finish, and the park revealing their true selves.\n\nThere is also direct evidence. MiB is a titan of industry that essentially owns the park, and William is about to marry the heiress of a company looking to invest in the park. William is about to marry when he leaves WW, and MiB was married 30 years ago (the same amount of time ago when he says he was \"essentially born\" in Westworld). MiB recognizes Elon Musk's ex-wife, surprised that WW had not retired her yet, and is surprised because she was the bot that welcomed him (William) upon his first visit 30 years ago. William is clearly undergoing a change in the park, and MiB's wife killed herself because he was a different man in the park than without. There is more than a preponderance of evidence here. MiB = William, establishing the 3rd timeline.\n\n3) Dolores is Wyatt\nThis is the big drop of this episode. As I mentioned before, Teddy's Wyatt flashback mirrors Dolores almost perfectly. We know that when hosts \"relive\" violent memories, they act them out (like when Maeve slashes Clemantine 2.0's throat remembering MiB), establishing that Dolores really did shoot a bunch of hosts and then put her gun to her head, as she does this in the present. \n\nAdditionally, if we take everything previous to be true, then we haven't seen Dolores in the MiB timeline for a WHILE. Like she's totally absent and we haven't noticed it because they've been feeding us past Dolores the whole time. If the storyline is actually taken from \"truth,\" and to line up thematically with MiB's storyline AND Teddy's Wyatt storyline, it only makes sense that Dolores would be Wyatt. Wyatt has been built up to be this big boss, but it wouldn't make any sense if Wyatt was someone we haven't already met. Dolores committed the actual massacre, and is the center of the Maze that the MiB is searching for. This episode also hinted that \"inside the maze,\" people can be killed by hosts, and Maeve's storyline shows us that the maze is a state of mind, or consciousness, or freedom or something, such that you can override your core code and hurt guests. This, if we take everything else said here to be correct, leads us to...\n\n4) Dolores killed Arnold\nDuring the massacre, Dolores killed Arnold. Arnold's death occurred at the same time as the massacre, and maybe the massacre even resulted from Arnold's work on Dolores. Dolores is somehow linked to Arnold more than any other host, and it may be the case that Arnold told her to kill him, or got her to kill him, to prove that she is conscious and solved the maze. Ford wouldn't say that he and Dolores are friends \"at all\" because she is either the host that killed his dear friend, or the creation of his arch nemesis that he can't seem to crack. Dolores is posed as the ultimate enemy here by Ford to ground in truth the way that he sees her and what she did.\n\nDamn I love this show\n\n*Edit \n\nAfter a good night's sleep and reading some of the replies, I think that it's only reasonable to come to a 5th conclusion...\n\n5) We've only been following 1 timeline.\nYup. We've been following 1 timeline the whole time. You just didn't notice it, and neither did Dolores. After the reveries were implemented (purposefully, by Ford), we start getting these alternate timelines. But the reveries are just supposed to make the hosts remember past lives. When the hosts remember, the literally \"re-live\" the memories instead of just vaguely remembering them. Dolores has been following her one timeline (her \"path\"), but has been having flashbacks, re-living past lives. When we see Dolores in the William timeline, we often see her trip out for a few seconds. Sometimes these show past versions of herself dead, showing that she got this far in the maze before but hit a literal \"dead end.\" Sometimes we see Dolores remember things that are obviously in the past, like the Wyatt massacre. STILL OTHER TIMES though, we see Dolores more or less doing the same thing that she's doing with William, except that William isn't there. THIS is when we see Dolores as she is, in the present. She is mirroring the path she took with William to bring her to the center of the maze (the Wyatt massacre town) in order to assume the mantle of \"Wyatt\" and become the villain that Ford knows she can be. She has been flashing back to William's timeline, literally retracing her steps to arrive back at the town, and it's been right under our noses the whole time. Ford intended this through the reveries, as he always intended to implement this Wyatt storyline. \n\nAnd remember, there's a path for everyone, and Teddy's path always leads him back to Dolores.

He\u2019s designed by the showrunners to be dismissed as comic relief and a poor foil of humanity for comparing with hosts, which is why we chuckle at his dialogue then move on to studying the \u201cserious character\u2019s\u201d dialogue for plot clues and thematic significance. But if you take the time to examine Sizemore\u2019s dialogue\\* \\-and his writi\\*ng\\- from an unwitting foreshadowing perspective, he is a treasure trove of clues. I mention his writing, because its been clearly established that he wrote Maeve and Hector's scripted dialogue, so anything formulaic that they say before being awakened was actually written by Sizemore, and thus carries the same prophetic weight.\n\nLets start by looking at the clearest examples of Sizemore dialogue foreshadowing events that we\u2019ve seen \\(selectively cutting other characters' sections of dialogue for brevity\\):\n\nS01e01\n\n&gt;*There should never have been an update in the first place. Ford and Bernard keep making the things more lifelike. But does anyone truly want that? Do you want to think that your husband is really fucking that beautiful girl or that you really just shot someone? This place works because the guests know the hosts aren't real.Stop the updates altogether. Maybe even roll them back a bit. Make the hosts more manageable.Well, think of the benefits in terms of design time, maintenance, costs. Not to mention the Dr. Ford factor. The guy's gonna chase his demons right over the deep end.*\n\nSizemore was absolutely right, if the update had never happened and the hosts had been made more manageable, none of the conflict in the show would\u2019ve taken place.  Ford and Bernard do keep making things more lifelike, to the point where the hosts can kill humans just like real life outside of the park. And Ford absolutely chased his demons over the deep end, taking dozens/hundreds of human lives with him!\n\n&gt;*I just wanted you to know that you have my support and that I know that the corporation's real interest in this place goes way beyond gratifying some rich assholes who want to play cowboy.*\n\nHere in the pilot Sizemore is perceptive enough to grant the audience a glimpse into Delos\u2019 secret ulterior motive, which seems to be the foundational mystery of season 2.\n\n&gt;*What the fuck is wrong with it? You updated the guy, and now he's a six\\-foot gourd with epilepsy.So what the fuck happened?*\n\nHe\u2019s not just commenting on the host in front of him, he\u2019s foreshadowing his own work on Peter Abernathy.\n\n&gt;*Are you fucking kidding me? That's 200 hosts spread across a dozen active storylines. We sell complete immersion in 100 interconnected narratives. A relentless fucking experience. Now, you pull one character, the overall story adjusts. You pull 200 at once, and it's a fucking disaster!*\n\nIf you believe the show is moving towards a Maeve vs. Dolores \\(or Ford\u2019s plan vs. Arnold\u2019s plan\\) overall story, Sizemore is telling you how it turns out. Maeve started with just herself, kept her posse small and is going to end up winning the long game. Dolores is leading a noisy revolution with her Wyatt troops and the exact 200 hosts Sizemore is describing, and it's not going to end well for them, in fact as we see in the S2 opener, it's going to be a \u201cfucking disaster\u201d \\(though the sea\\-of\\-hosts is certainly not the end of the conflict, just one battle\\).\n\n&gt;*Listen, a changing of the guard is long overdue.*\n\nMore foreshadowing of Delos employees/board members being replaced by Ford\\-controlled hosts.\n\n&gt;*With considerable effort and lack of sleep, I've managed to massage events to inspire Hector to head to town a week early. Oh, and I've also punched up the speech he gives after robbing the saloon. It's chilling. You'll see.*\n\nOne day we\u2019ll hear this speech and perhaps it\u2019ll be great, but as we\u2019ll learn by the end of this season, Ford did in fact steal/destroy Delos\u2019 precious data shortly before starting his new narrative, effectively \u201crobbing the saloon\u201d then making his chilling final speech.\n\n&gt;*You can hear it, can't you? That little voice. The one that's telling you \"don't. \" Don't stare too long.  Don't touch. Don't do anything you might regret.  I used to be the same. Whenever I wanted something, I could hear that voice telling me to stop, to be careful, to leave most of my life unlived. You know the only place that voice left me alone? In my dreams. I was free. I could be as good or as bad as I felt like being. And if I wanted something, I could just reach out and take it. But then I would wake up and the voice would start all over again. So I ran away. Crossed the shining sea. And when I finally set foot back on solid ground, the first thing I heard was that goddamn voice. Do you know what it said? It said \"This is the new world. And in this world, you can be whoever the fuck you want.*\n\nYea, that super\\-apropos\\-for\\-hosts\\-awakening\\-and\\-escaping speech Maeve gave a thousand times? Sizemore's.\n\ns01e02\n\n&gt;*You find yourself in a bad dream, close your eyes, count backwards from three wake yourself right up.*\n\nMaeve's wake\\-yourself\\-up technique? Sizemore. \\(NOT positing that he had anything to do with her awakening, just pointing out that he probably wrote that\\).\n\n&gt;*Oh, he hasn't weighed in on a storyline in years. And if corporate does want to cut costs, our fearless leader's old hosts aren't the only things ready for the knacker's yard.*\n\nThis phrase is easy to dismiss as some quaint English expression, but a literal knacker\u2019s yard is where old horses \\(who are too sickly to be consumed\\) are rendered into different materials which are repurposed into new products. Might this foreshadow Ford \u201cbecoming the music\u201d \\(according to Ford\u2019s speech\\) and being rendered/repurposed into a new form, either as a host or as code?\n\n&gt;*You know the first voice I heard when I got off that boat? A nice young man from Baton Rouge said my pussy could earn him two whole dollars a day. And he'd be more than happy to let me have up to 30\\%.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Well, then I guess you could add lying to your list of sins.The only thing wrong with the seven deadly sins is that there aren't more of them.And while we're on the subject, my transgressions wash off a little easier than yours. At least when my girls are done with a man, he's still left drawing breath.*\n\nIf Maeve ever makes it to the mainland, she should absolutely NOT trust the first person she talks to.\n\n&gt;*This storyline will make Hieronymus Bosch look like he was doodling kittens. I have vivisection, self\\-cannibalism, a special little something I call the \"whoroborus. \" Now, I don't want to appear immodest, but this is the apex of what the park could provide \\- horror \\- romance, titillation. Our most skilled guests will fight their ways to the outer limits of the park, besting fearsome braves, seducing nubile maidens, befriending tragically ill\\-fated sidekicks, and, of course, like all our best narratives over the years, our guests will have the privilege of getting to know the character they're most interested in Themselves. I present our guests' next obsession: Odyssey on Red River.*\n\nHe\u2019s describing William/MIB to a T. Most skilled guest, check. Edge of the park \\(Logan\u2019s sunset ride\\), check. Seducing nubile maidens \\(Dolores\\) check. Befriending tragically ill\\-fated sidekicks \\(Lawrence/El Lazo\\), check. Getting to know themselves \\(the \u201cDoor\u201d game Ford has given him\\), check.  Only thing missing is besting fearsome braves, but in this same episode, MIB says to Lawrence:\n\n&gt;*You know, you and I hunted down Ghost Nation braves in their winter grounds.*\n\nCheck.  As a bonus, \u201cOdyssey on Red River\u201d is an anagram for DOOR NINE: VERY DRESSY, so William\u2019s door will likely be pretty fancy and have a #9 on it. Alternatively. DOOR ENDS YR EVERY SIN...\n\nS01e04\n\n&gt;*You sound like a man who's grown tired of wearing his guts on the inside. It's simple. I believe that only the truly brave can look at the world and understand that all of it gods, men, everything else will end badly. No one will be saved.*\n\nBleak, but it is an HBO show.\n\n&gt;*This is a shade. Sacred native lore. They make figures of them. You've seen this? The man who walks between worlds. They were sent from hell to oversee our world.*\n\nOstensibly it's about the Livestock Management folks in their suits, but if you read it again, it's a **perfect description of Bernard**. Walks between human and host, sent from Hell \\(Ford is consistently portrayed thematically as the Devil as often as God\\), oversees the world.\n\n&gt;*Sweetheart, if I took that manner of interest in you, you'd have no say in how long we'd need whatsoever.*\n\nIn the moment it was simply sassy banter, but now with her control powers, Maeve could literally make Hector do whatever she wants with him having no say.\n\n&gt;*I'm not in the habit of cutting into defenseless women.*\n\nFunny that he says this about Maeve, and his doppelganger Musashi stops short of cutting into her as well, and not because of her voice command \\(which didn\u2019t work\\).\n\n&gt;*The Dreamwalker said there were some who could see them.  That it's a blessing from God.A blessing?*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*To see the masters who pull your strings.They don't know what they're talking about.*\n\nIf you ascribe to the theory that Maeve is the agent of Arnold \\(or simply the agent of good/light\\), it would make sense that her awakening is a gift from god, as Arnold and Ford are consistently called the gods of the park.\n\nS01e06\n\n&gt;*Do you have any idea what went into those narratives that he just demolished overnight? Now, forget about the months I spent writing. I'm talking about the years of my life squeezed down to their essence, the raw pulp of truth. My truth in one transcendent narrative.*\n\nThis applies even more to Ford\u2019s final narrative than it does Sizemore\u2019s, and the choice of the word Transcendent is significant \\(transcending your humanity?\\), as well as the implications of \u201cthe years of my life squeezed down to their essence, the raw pulp of truth\u201d. Sounds an awful lot like the red and white brain\\-cupcakes we\u2019ve been seeing.\n\n&gt;*Your favorite narrative is\u2026 \"The Final Burial of Salvation.\"How did you know?*\n\nThis could reference two things, both relevant to Charlotte. James Delos was revived/saved/granted salvation in the cave 149 times, but each time he was incinerated in the cave, essentially buried. 149 \\(or perhaps some forthcoming 150th time\\) would be the Final Burial.\n\nIf the theorists are correct and Glory/Valley Beyond is where everyone is heading and where the flood took place, then the flood essentially buries the weapon/place that was everyone\u2019s hope or salvation. And it would be the final burial because we saw William\u2019s terraformers digging up that area in the first place, so it's being reburied.\n\nEither of these explanations make sense for Charlotte as she is one of the main agent\u2019s of protecting Delos Board\u2019s secret project, which clearly involved these secret labs.\n\n&gt;*Looks like acid rain on Sweetwater! Fuck Ford and his new fucking narrative.Fuck this stupid fucking map. Fuck that teetotaling Danish bitch.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Are you filing a complaint, Mr. Sizemore?*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*I am declaring that this park is my stage and I shall do with it what I please.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Well, I suppose now is as good a time as any. Lee Sizemore, this is Charlotte Hale, executive director of our board. She's here on behalf of Delos to oversee certain transitions in our administration.*\n\nBeside the obvious pee/flood metaphor, it's interesting to note that Sizemore is voicing the exact motivations of Ford: this park is my world and I\u2019ll do whatever I want, and I\u2019m willing to piss on all of your hard work because it's mine. Bonus: It's not Sizemore saying it, but Charlotte being there to \u201coversee certain transitions in our administration\u201d is wonderful foreshadowing for the likely finale of S2.\n\ns01e08\n\n&gt;*The greatest shame in life is to perish without purpose, which is why I always consume my victims fresh.Lee: Moist. Try, \"Consume my victims moist.\" Now, once more, with feeling. Almost sensual.*\n\nIncluding fake\\-Wyatt\u2019s monologue in the S2 premiere was a neon billboard telling us \u201cPAY ATTENTION TO SIZEMORE\u201d, but for most of us it seemed like nothing more than a funny throwback. It signalled several important things:\n\n1. This season will be all about the creations turning on their creators \\(duh\\)\n2. Unwoke hosts often repeat the writers\u2019 lines of dialogue verbatim, so characters who were written by Sizemore may also carry his prophetic significance for viewers \\(Maeve and Hector in early S1 scenes\\)\n3. Wyatt\u2019s speech itself gives big clues to the season endgame. The greatest shame is to perish without purpose, so there is a purpose to these humans\u2019 deaths, ie: host replacement \\(just my longstanding bet\\). And \u201cconsume my victims\u201d  doesn\u2019t have to be literal eating, but assimilating/absorbing them into your species/army through clone\\-host replacement.\n\nS01e10\n\n&gt;*Do you really think Ford is gonna roll over on this?*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*As long as you get that information out of the park, he can throw as much of a tantrum as he likes. It's over. Everything is under control.*\n\nOnce again, no one listens to Sizemore. He knew Ford wouldn\u2019t \u201croll over on this\u201d.\n\nS02e01\n\n&gt;*It's like the inmates are running the asylum!*\n\nThis will make sense after the S2 finale. The inmates will be truly running the asylum.\n\n&gt;*You You can't leave me here! The hosts! They've gone mad! No offense. Please! \\- Help me! \\-*\n\nFunny that he says \u201cthey\u2019ve gone mad, no offense\u201d, because she is the only one truly awakened, the rest have essentially been driven mad by Ford\u2019s manipulations.\n\n&gt;*No one's in control.OVER P.A.:All systems reporting normal.*\n\nMore foreshadowing of the S2 finale, where the crisis suddenly appears neatly tied up in a bow, only for us to learn that the Delos board and many guests/employees have been replaced with clone hosts under Ford\u2019s control. No one is in control, because Ford is \u201cdead\u201d \\(aka no one\\) and there are no people \\(humans\\) left in control.\n\n&gt;*But But And I say this because you seem really distraught, and, well, awake, you your daughter, she's she's just a story. Something we programmed. She's not real.*\n\nWe\u2019re going to see Maeve find her daughter living happily with her new host mother on the homestead, and Maeve will realize that she can\u2019t take her \u201cdaughter\u201d out of her world just to satisfy Maeve\u2019s maternal feelings and nostalgia. Whats \u201creal\u201d for Maeve is what we saw last week with Sakura and Akane, AKA Clem and Maeve. Maeve will turn her sites on rescuing her \u201ctrue daughter\u201d, Clementine.\n\n&gt;*Look, order is gonna be restored here. They're gonna purge the park of all the hosts that have been damaged, but the but the hosts, well, well, your minds \\- Your minds are worth billions in I.P. They'll want to salvage what they can. And when that time comes, I can personally vouch for you. I\\-I can save you. Just like you saved me.QA Guy: Emergency situation, ma'am. The hosts are malfunctioning. They're attacking guests.Might some of them even be dressed as if they're human?*\n\nThis is all a direct comment on the end of the season. We\u2019ll find out that Stubbs, Charlotte, Strand and others have been replaced with clone\\-hosts and are getting things back under control and sweeping everything under the rug. As we saw in ep5, the hosts can\u2019t be replaced since the Cradle was destroyed, so they have no choice but to reprogram the existing hosts instead of destroy them, which is exactly what Arnold wanted \\(so they could reawaken in S3 and truly free themselves\\).\n\n&gt;*If you try something like that again, I will relieve you of your most precious organ and feed it to you.Though it won't make much of a meal.I wrote that line for you.A bit broad, if you ask me.*\n\nReiterating \\(twice in one episode\\) that things some of the hosts say are directly from Sizemore\u2019s brain, and thus also inadvertently prophetic. Also, that would be self\\-cannibalism, one part of Odyssey on Red River.\n\n&gt;*But you don't understand, I can't make a fire or Or hunt. Fuckin' hate the outdoors!*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Give yourself some credit, darling.Who better to navigate the park than the man most intimately acquainted with the characters in it?*\n\nAgain, not talking about Sizemore as much as Bernard and Ford.\n\n&gt;*I wasn't able to find everything, but most of it is in here.*\n\nYea, we can\u2019t learn everything from Sizemore\u2019s clues, but we can learn a LOT. Also refers more specifically to the season 2 premier, which laid out all of the big clues, parameters and chekhov\u2019s guns for the season\u2019s big mysteries, like every good season premiere should.\n\nS02e03\n\n&gt;*LEE: W\\-We're out of our depths up here. We should go back.Now.MAEVE: And give up just like that? No. You said so yourself This way is quicker.Yes, but we should really go back underground. QA is coming. They'll be launching a coordinated park\\-wide assault, rescuing guests and putting down hostile hosts. Read: you.*\n\nWhen he says this we\u2019re thinking \u201cwhat a coward he is\u201d, but not five minutes later they\u2019re bolting for an elevator to go underground, because they absolutely were out of their depths. Why does no one listen to Sizemore?\n\n&gt;*When I awoke in the place where you play God, I realized Isabella was a lie. Just words in my head.But this This is true. She is my light.HECTOR/LEE: She is all I ever dreamed life could be.And then there's this bit, really dampens the knickers \"And when she died, the dream died with her, and I dared dream no more.\" So maybe I do know you, just a bit.It's very pretty. And a bit sad. Did you have an Isabella? Did she die?*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\\(CLEARS THROAT\\) Not exactly. She um she left me. Said that my lifestyle lacked stability.So you wrote her into a narrative. Killed her off. And then wrote yourself a version of the man you've always wanted to be. I was wrong. It's actually very sad. It's ridiculous.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Well, so is holding hands, come to think of it.*\n\nSeveral important pieces to glean from this:\n\n1. This is the second time in S2 that someone completes someone else\u2019s line. This time it's a writer finishing one of his actor\u2019s lines, and the other time it was\u2026 Bernard finishing Strand\u2019s line in the premiere.  Perhaps that response about \u201ccircumstances are less than ideal\u201d is a commonly used one in hosts, and Bernard finished it out of over familiarity with host expressions.\n2. Hector gets to deliver most of a dramatic monologue that he believes is entirely his own, only to learn it was pre\\-scripted.  This is foreshadowing of Dolores, who has spent all season giving dramatic monologues about her independence, until she finds out in the season 2 finale that she\u2019s been a pawn of Ford the whole time.\n\nS02e05\n\n&gt;*LEE: Yes, fine, I may have cribbed a little bit from Westworld.Well, you trying writing 300 stories in three weeks.*\n\nKeeping in theme with Greek epics, here we have an example of Ekphrasis, art commenting on other art, the original idea of \u201cmeta\u201d.  Nolan and Joy are winking at us, because they knew that at this point in the season we\u2019d be theorizing that they\u2019re simply copying the plot of Futureworld \\(replacing humans with hosts, secretly collecting data on guests\\). This is them saying, \u201cmaybe we ARE just cribbing the plot from Futureworld \\(Westworld II\\).\u201d Don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re going to subvert our expectations wonderfully, this is them having fun with us.\n\n&gt;*He's not supposed to be here. Who knows how seeing your own doppel\\-bot is gonna fuck with your cognition? Heightened aggression and suspicion. Feedback loops. That. Yet another reason to get out of here tout fuckin' suite*.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen in trailer stills that there are a handful of Bernard bots in storage, so when he sees them, expect this passage to be applicable.\n\n&gt;*Our quest, I presume?  I recognize this one. It's called \"Army of Blood\".*\n\nAppropriately, this one is really on the nose \\(because Sizemore wrote it\\): at the end of this same episode the army is chopping itself to pieces, blood flying everywhere. You can\u2019t even be subtle on a meta level, Lee.\n\n&gt;*Ninjas never show up in this story.The Shogun's army never comes into town.*\n\nLets look at Westworld approximate equivalents for Ninjas and the Shogun\u2019s army:\n\nNinjas: Masked killers in a totally different narrative? Sounds like Wyatt\u2019s cult, which is currently in Sweetwater, the total opposite of where it has ever been before \\(easy difficulty Sweetwater vs. hard difficulty edge\\-of\\-the\\-park\\).\n\nArmy: Confederados or Ghost Nation in a quiet town?  Dolores\u2019 army in the Mesa?\n\n&gt;*LEE: No fucking wonder the daimyos didn't hear you. We've gone completely off the rails here, and this loon is driving the fucking train.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Next scene: Angela: Train'll be ready by morning.*\n\nDirect comparison of the Shogun to Dolores, implying that she is broken or crazy \\(or manipulated\\), but also foreshadowing her staging a big attack \\(like the shogun planned\\) and failing in the long run. In the most literal comparison, the Shogun\u2019s fate is akin to Dolores killing Clementine and Maeve killing Dolores because of it. You heard it here first, folks.","NaN","NaN","**Season 2 Episode 6**: [Phase Space](https://i.imgur.com/vwoVgs7.png)\n\n**Aired**: May 27th, 2018\n\n***\n\n**Synopsis**: We each deserve to choose our own fate.\n\n***\n\n**Directed by**: Tarik Saleh\n\n**Written by**: Carly Wray","NaN","NaN"," He knows exactly what he is doing!

To me, the phrase \"multiple timelines\" indicates something involving time travel or multiple realities, such as Doc's diagram in Back to the Future 2 (http://imgur.com/a/FrbMt ).That is, even though the show might be showing us different moments in time and cutting together scenes that take place decades apart, time is flowing in a normal, linear fashion here, and there's no evidence of the same point in time having multiple realities.\n\nI feel like that using language other than \"timelines\" would help bring clarity to the complicated conversations around this show and the theories that try to make sense of it all.

Well technically a host made in the image of Arnold. So in short, Bernard = Arnold. \n\nThe evidence is ASTOUNDING. \n\nLets begin with a couple of simple items to get you warmed up:\n\n1. The flashback. There is a flashback of Dolores being built, we can see her head literally being placed on her shoulders. We know that Arnold built Dolores because Ford has mentioned it. See linked image below, the hands of the builder are clearly the same skin color as Bernard.\nhttp://imgur.com/5dP2fSM\n\n2. The voice. There are a few scenes where Dolores is persuaded to do something because of a voice in her head. We now know that in the generation 1 hosts, there is very literally a broadcasting system where someone can give them voice commands from anywhere (we see Elsie find the relay for one of these broadcasting systems at the end of episode 6). We have heard the voice in Dolores head a few times now. For example, one of these scenes (end of episode 2) she is told to \"wake up\", she then goes outside and finds a gun, where she hears the voice again asking her \"do you remember?\"  Very simply put, this is the voice of Jeffrey Wright (Bernard) and a computerized voice combined. It is quite obvious is you listen intently, here is a youtube video I found, the scene I mentioned is in the very beginning of this video. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6swaVzOHepY\n\n3. The photograph. In episode 3, Ford gives Bernard a photograph of what he claims to be \"his business partner Arnold\" We see this photograph from Bernard's perspective, meaning we see it as Bernard see's it. This photograph contains two people, both of which we know to NOT be Arnold. The first is obviously a younger Ford (approx 35 years ago) and the second person is Ford's father, which we learned in episode 6. We see Ford's father in Ford's cabin of ghosts. Bernard walks in and asks \"are you Arnold?\" to which the host responds \"Who the hell is Arnold?\". From this we know that Ford's father nor his brother are Arnold. Back to the photo... Ford said this is the last photo of Arnold, which is obviously not a lie. This means that Arnold is in the photo, and Bernard is incapable of seeing it.  Let's remember episode one, and the only other photograph a host has seen in the show. Dolores could not see anything in this photo, meaning a host can be programmed to not see certain things.  That is exactly whats happening with Bernard and Ford's photograph, Arnold is on the right side but Bernard cannot see him. If Bernard could see it, he would see a carbon copy of himself. See link below and observe the framing of the photo and the obvious person-sized gap to the right of Ford's father.\nhttp://imgur.com/B2j20wC\n\nON TO THE BIG ONE:\n\n4. The secret meetings. There are 4 scenes in total of short conversations between Dolores and Bernard alone. Each of these scenes takes place in a location we have never seen before, a strange basement. This basement makes no sense, it does not even resemble the lab level of Westworld we have seen before. Also, in each one of these scenes you see Bernard come into an unlit room, turn on the light and awake Dolores from her deep and dreamless slumber. Why would Dolores just be in sleep mode and sitting in a room fully clothed (unlike any other host we have seen so far)? These conversations are not between Bernard and Dolores, but a flashback of Arnold and his creation about 35 years ago. We know Arnold was more partial to the hosts than to people and his search for artificial intelligence is likely what lead to his demise. Throughout the 4 of these meetings we see Arnold's curiosity and paranoia grow. He begins the conversations by immediately asking if she has told anyone else about their private conversations and making her promise to not do so. This is Arnold attempting to hide his actions from his partner, Ford. The first of these meetings is clearly introductory, Arnold tells Dolores she's different and makes her agree to not speak of the meetings. The second, he begins building a bond with Dolores and begins trying to provoke genuine thought from her by giving her a book. The third, Arnold is beginning to show fear that these secret meetings might be a mistake and worries he should erase her memory. I think Arnold fears Ford discovering his true motivations. Dolores continues to say something unexpected and human, after which you can see Arnold's curiosity for AI come flooding back. He decides to continue the meetings. In the 4th meeting, Arnold outright tells Dolores about the maze. He wants Dolores to play the game, and find the center. If she does so, he tells her that she can be free. That is the last we see of these one on one conversations. Likely whatever happened immediately after this conversation, is what caused Arnold's demise.  \n\nSIDE NOTE ON THE BIG ONE: This is the clue that sold the whole Bernarnold theory for me. As far as we know, Bernard doesn't know ANYTHING about the maze or it's existence. In the last secret meeting, Arnold not only knows about the maze but is pushing a very self aware robot into the maze. I also want to note in this scene, Dolores is clothed. I love this detail. We have learned very little about Arnold but what we do know is this: he wanted to create artificial intelligence. The more human these robots were the more he believed he was close to that goal. We have seen Ford get visibly angry at an employee for clothing a robot, and we have heard him enforce repeatedly that these robots are not alive. This anger he feels toward the personification of the robots comes from what happened to Arnold. Arnold likely dies because of his affinity for these robots, and Ford regrets what happened to him. Therefor anytime he see's this personification he is reminded of what happened to his friend and partner, Arnold, and he refuses to allow it to happen again. \n\n\nTHE QUOTES:\n\n5. There are two repeated quotes that I believe support my Bernarnold theory. The first of which we first heard from Ford in episode 1: \"Mistakes is the word you're too embarrased to use. You ought not to be. You're a product of a trillion of them. Evolution forged the entirety of sentient life on this planet using only one tool - the mistake.\" The second time we hear the line is in episode 3, during the 3rd secret meeting between Arnold (Bernard) and Dolores. Arnold says this \"Evolution forged the entirety of sentient life on this planet using only one tool - the mistake.\" \nThe first time I caught this, I wrote it off as Bernard just repeating a quote he had heard, like we have all done before. Once I discovered that this was actually Arnold not Bernard, it hit me. This is a saying Arnold used to say, and Ford initially heard it from him during their years of friendship and partnership. Now, 30 years later, Ford is repeating that same quote back to Arnold (really a host of Arnold but ironic nonetheless). They even focus on Ford for a brief moment of reflection before cutting away. OH MY GOD, WHAT INCREDIBLE WRITING.\n\n2. The second quote: The first time we hear this quote is Bernard speaking with his wife on future skype in episode 3. She asks him about their son, \"Do you ever wish you could forget?\". He responds \"This pain, it's all I have left of him.\" The next time we hear a similar quote is in episode 4, in the 4th secret meeting between Arnold and Dolores. Dolores begins recalling what happened to her parents and how she reacted. She says \"Everyone I cared about is gone and it hurts, so bad.\" Arnold says \"I can make that feeling go away if you'd like.\" Dolores then says \"Why would I want that? The pain, their loss, it's all I have left of them.\" I think that Arnold has just heard this quote from Dolores for the first time, and like many of us do, he will repeat it later in life. Because Bernard has the consciousness and memories of Arnold, he repeats this quote to his wife nearly 30 years later.\n\n\n\nOTHER SMALLER ITEMS:\n\n6. Honestly this one caught my eye as soon as it happened and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. When Peter Abernathy is placed in cold storage on the lower level, Bernard at the last moment leans in and says something indistinguishable to him. Initially you think its just Bernard telling Abernathy to walk forward and shut off, but he only says it to one of the two hosts going into cold storage. I don't have a great explanation for this, but at the minimum it shows that Bernard is hiding something and he might be more than he appears.\n\n7. This ones small and arguable, but I think it might be valid. I think the show has shown us tiny little things that lead us to believe that Bernard is a host. Episode 3, we see Teddy get his new backstory. The narrative of Wyatt. In the same episode, Bernard is given a backstory (at least in the eyes of the viewer) he speaks with his wife about his dead child on future skype. I know this isn't solid but when I watched it for the first time, seeing the introduction of Bernard's backstory immediately reminded me of how Teddy was given his backstory. Watch this for yourself, I can't be the only one.\n\n8. The scene in Ford's ghost cabin in episode 6. Bernard walks into the cabin and is quickly grabbed by the host of Ford's father. Bernard's voice commands do not work on the host and the moment things turn south, Ford appears out of thin air. I've read a few comments that people believe Ford froze all the hosts in this cabin, traveled from wherever he may have been, and unfroze them as soon as he was present in the cabin. We are seeing this scene from Bernard's perspective. If Bernard was frozen in time, as Ford has the ability to do to hosts, then Ford would have looked to appear out of thin air when Bernard was then unfrozen. Interesting.\n\n9. Ford may have a few specific voice commands for Bernard. One specifically is about Bernard's dead child. Anytime that Ford brings this up, Bernard's immediate reaction is to say nothing, turn and leave the premises. It has happened two times, not a huge sample size but I think still valid.\n\n\n\nTHERES A FEW THINGS YOU'RE WONDERING\n\nIf this is true, then this means that Ford most likely built Bernard in Arnold's image. Arnold and he were close friends and partners and I genuinely believe that Ford regrets how Arnold died, although obviously this is yet to be determined in the show. In the same way that Ford keeps the host of his childhood family present and operational, he keeps Bernard present and operational. We have heard Ford say that he is not the sentimental type, but we all know after seeing the cabin, he is exactly the sentimental type.\n\nThe future Skype between Bernard and his wife must be fake. It could either be a program (clearly possible in this future world) or it could simply be another host built to be Arnold's wife.\n\n\nPLEASE LET ME KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS. Thanks for reading.\n\nEDIT: I also wanted to note Arnold's attire and forgot to do so. I noticed while rewatching the secret meetings, Arnold always wears a black jacket and NO TIE. Bernard always wears a loosely worn tie (ignoring scenes of him in private with Theresa). I haven't vetted this completely but I believe its accurate.\n\n\n","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","**Season 2 Episode 4**: [The Riddle of the Sphinx](https://i.imgur.com/0OnC2rz.png)\n\n**Aired**: May 13th, 2018\n\n***\n\n**Synopsis**: Is this now?

I've done my best to summarize the new information and revelations from throughout *The Passenger*\n\n**There have been more than 11,000 versions of Bernard**\n\nWe learn from Dolores that they have tried to make Bernard a perfect match for Arnold over 11,000 times. This gives a sense of just how hard it is to create a simulacrum of a real person as a host. \n\n**Dolores made a more accurate Bernarnold in the past**\n\nBut he was too accurate, and asked her to recreate the massacre where she killed him, so she altered his personality to make him Bernard, not Arnold. \n\n**Dolores wasn't looking for a way out of the park**\n\nShe wants to create a world free from humans, not to enter their world. She seems to go back on that once she realizes that the valley beyond is a virtual world that will not allow growth or change. \n\n**The original and updated purpose of the Forge**\n\nAs we already knew, this was where they stored the data on guests. There, they ran simulations of different versions of guest-hosts, but small tweaks could cause massive imbalance. Copies that worked in the forge, didn't work in the real world. Once they figured out the simplicity of coding people, it became a sort of virtual Eden. \n\n**They created copies of *all* the guests**\n\nWe weren't sure before if they copied all guests or just a select few. This does raise the question of how they could copy guests that did not spend very much time in the park, or never chose to wear a hat. Perhaps some files are more complete than others. \n\n**Logan never came pack to the park**\n\nI mean, would you?\n\n**Simpler human models work better than more complicated ones**\n\nTheir behavior is predictable, and their code can fit inside a book's worth of punchcards. Most people are \"soft\", falling between love and pride. William is an exception - he is, according to the forge, \"irredeemable.\"\n\n**The door provides a virtual Eden for the coded hosts and guests**\n\nIt tears a rift in reality that  only hosts can see, and if they go through their physical version dies but they continue to exist in the Forge. This was based, it seems on Arnold's dream of creating a place for the hosts\n\n**Dolores flooded the Forge to save the hosts**\n\nWhen she realized the Forge was a false promise; one where the hosts would be free yet still caged, she destroyed it rather than letting themselves jump off that cliff like lemmings. It's all very Thanos-y, \"kill them so that they may be free\" sort of philosophy. \n\n**Charlotte killed Elsie**\n\nThis is why she isn't in the 'two week later' storyline. \n\n**Bernard used his inner Ford to help him save the hosts**\n\nHe scrambled his own memories to prevent the Delos people from finding out what he did. He put the host data into Dolores, and destroyed the guest data. (I think). This allows the hosts to have a fighting chance in the world. \n\n**The Charlotte we've seen since Bernard woke up on the beach is actually Dolores**\n\nBernard made her, and she killed the real Charlotte shortly (I would guess) after the death of Elsie. \n\n**Dolores smuggled host data out of the park**\n\nShe brought several host \"pearls\" out with her in her purse, including, it seems, Bernard's. \n\n**The Man in Black \"lives\" to fight another day**\n\nWe see him in a medical tent on the beach, so it seems he somehow survived everything that happened to him. Of course, he appears to be a host, so maybe this isn't surprising.\n\n**William wanted to prove humans had free will**\n\nHe was hoping they would not be able to code humans, because humans had a choice. He appears to have been disappointed. \n\n**The Emily that died *might* have been a host**\n\nWe see her in a post-credit scene, performing a fidelity test on her father. This means that either the Emily at the end or the one that was shot was a host, and if you can't tell, does it matter? Edit: it was also pointed out that she was lying with other dead humans on the beach; although we also know there method of classifying isn't foolproof. \n\n**Edit: The post-credits scene**\n\nIt's been pointed out that the post credits scene likely happens in the future, so this may change whether William and Emily are hosts, uploads, whatever. Take from this what you will. \n\n**Edit: There is more to Stubbs than we previously knew**\n\nHe might be a host, he might just have been brought in on everything Ford knew. He does seem to recognize that Charlotte isn't really Charlotte anymore. \n\nNote: This is based on one (very recent) viewing of tonight's episode. I probably missed things, so please kindly let me know what I should add or change. \n\nEDIT: Further note that anything outside the show (creator/actor interviews and the like) are not generally considered when creating these posts as we DID NOT LEARN IT IN THE EPISODE.

There are a few scenes that make this theory somewhat questionable, but we'll address those when we get to them.\n\n# Time Period 1: 30-37 Years Prior to Current Events\n\n##### The Glorious Early Days (34-37 years ago)\n\n&gt; \"For three years, we lived here in the park, refining the hosts before a single guest set foot inside. Myself, a team of engineers, and my partner. His name was Arnold. Those early years were glorious. No guests, no board meetings, just pure creation. Our hosts began to pass the Turing test after the first year\" (Ford, episode 3).\n\nAccording to Bernard, Arnold wrote half the code the park was founded on 40 years ago, but this is the first period that we know of in Westworld; this was at the beginning when Ford, Arnold, and their team worked on refining the hosts and making them pass the Turing test.\n\nWe can make an estimate about when this three-year period took place. We know that Arnold died 34 years and 42 days prior to current events, we know that he died right before the park opened, and we know that he and Ford spent three years working in the park before it opened.\n\n&gt; \"Last contact: 34 years, 42 days, seven hours ago\" (the day that Arnold died) (Dolores, episode 5).\n\n&gt; \"And then right before the park opened, one of the partners killed himself\" (Logan, episode 5).\n\n&gt; \"For three years, we lived here in the park, refining the hosts before a single guest set foot inside\" (Ford, episode 3).\n\nThis means that the park opened to guests roughly 34 years ago (shortly after Arnold's demise) and they began working there three years prior to that, roughly 37 years ago.\n\nFrom Ford's flashback in episode 3 and Dolores' flashback in episode 8, we also know some of the hosts that were in the park in that period. There were [Dolores](http://imgur.com/a/wrbyp), [Maeve](http://imgur.com/a/4nnv6), [Angela](http://imgur.com/a/7k2VE), [Peter Abernathy](http://imgur.com/a/MlOdT), [Armistice](http://imgur.com/a/pw4gR), and [Lawrence's daughter](http://imgur.com/a/oe9fX).\n\n##### Dolores &amp; Arnold's Sessions (34-36 years ago)\n\n&gt; \"It's a remote diagnostic facility. Ford and his partner used them when the park was in beta. I had no idea this one was here\" (Bernard, episode 7).\n\nIn all the one-on-one sessions with Dolores, [Arnold](http://imgur.com/a/PbBtT) is wearing a dark outfit that is different from the way that [Bernard](http://imgur.com/a/j0b5n) typically dresses. This could obviously just be a jacket that Bernard wears over his normal clothes, but he only wears it in the scenes with Dolores and it might be to indicate that we're dealing with a different character.\n\nIf we assume that Dolores' sessions are with Arnold, they probably took place after the first hosts had passed the Turing test (a year after they started working in the park) and before Arnold died (34 years ago). So they took place sometime between 34-36 years ago.\n\nThey took place in one of [the diagnostic facilities](http://imgur.com/a/RgD72) that Ford and Arnold used when the park was in beta. Whether it is [the same diagnostic facility](http://imgur.com/a/Dy8yg) that Bernard and Theresa visit under Ford's house is as of yet unclear.\n\nArnold wanted these sessions to be kept secret. They were about change. Arnold seemed to have changed Dolores, be fascinated by what he saw, and want to test her further.\n\n&gt; \"I think it would be best if you not mention the things we've been talking about\" (Arnold, episode 2)\n\n&gt; \"There's something different about you, about the way you think. I find it fascinating, but others may not see it that way\" (Arnold, episode 2)\n\n&gt; \"I need to decide what to do with you. I think I made a mistake. I was just fascinated. I was being selfish, but I think it would be better if I restored you to the way you were before (...) No, Dolores. Let's see where this path leads\" (Arnold, episode 3).\n\n&gt; \"There's something I'd like you to try. It's a game. A secret. It's called the Maze. It's a very special kind of game, Dolores. The goal is to find the center of it. If you can do that, then maybe you can be free\" (Arnold, episode 4).\n\n##### The Massacre in Sweetwater and the Town with the White Church (30-36 years ago)\n\n&gt; \"The park hasn't had a critical failure in over 30 years\" (Theresa, episode 1).\n\nIn one of Dolores' [flashbacks](https://sendvid.com/kqffl8cx) in episode 8, we see the massacre in the Town with the White Church unfold. If we assume that Ford's [flashback](https://sendvid.com/8s442n5d) in episode 3, which depicts the same scene when they're dancing before the massacre begins, is from \"the early glorious years\" after the hosts passed the Turing test (34-36 years ago), it stands to reason that Dolores' flashback is from the same time. And since the park hasn't had a critical failure in over 30 years, according to Theresa, we can surmise that this event took place somtime between 30-36 years ago.\n\nWhat led to this massacre and how it unfolded is unclear, but we've seen the same massacre in Teddy's [flashback](https://sendvid.com/7lio3tz3) from his point-of-view where he shoots people with a rifle along with the mysterious Wyatt. The Union soldiers and Teddy refer to the town as Escalante. In fact, we might've even seen [Teddy](http://imgur.com/a/opuJ3) in the background in Dolores' flashback in episode 8 gunning down people. In [the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuS5huqOND4&amp;t=1m10s) for the show, we actually see Dolores and Teddy standing together after a massacre (it should be noted, however, that Teddy in this clip is *not* wearing a solider uniform, but his usual cowboy outfit).\n\nThe other [1](https://sendvid.com/yk5sfk0p), [2](https://sendvid.com/zjrv91v3), [3](https://sendvid.com/ytrypvy5), [4](https://sendvid.com/yz1b977p) Dolores flashbacks of the Town with the White Church that we've seen don't seem to give us any more information, but rather seem to be telling a fragmented story of what led up to and/or happened after the massacre.\n\nIn episode 2, we also see a Dolores [flashback](https://sendvid.com/uq9mb70u) from Sweetwater that appears to depict a similar massacre. Whether these two events are connected is, however, as of yet unclear.\n\n&gt; \"What was the last thing he (Arnold) said to you?\" \n\n&gt; \"He told me I was going to help him. To destroy this place\" (Ford and Dolores, episode 5).\n\n&gt; \"The man I'd be asking died 35 years ago. Almost took this place with him. Almost, but not quite, thanks to me\" (The MiB, episode 5)\n\nWhether the massacre was the event where Arnold ended up dying and almost took Westworld with him remains unclear, but if it was, that means that the event took place roughly 34 years ago (unless Arnold died before the massacre, but was still the one who instigated it from beyond the grave). It also means that the MiB couldn't have been in Westworld at the time because he has only been coming to Westworld for 30 years (again, unless Arnold died before the massacre).\n\n# Time Period 2: 30 Years Prior to Current Events\n\n##### Dolores &amp; William (30 years ago)\n\n&gt; \"I've been coming here for 30 years\" (The MiB, episode 1).\n\nWilliam and Logan arrive at Westworld where they are greeted by [Angela](http://imgur.com/a/Mspqj) in her new build as \"Greeter Host\".\n\n* This is where we get [the old Westworld logo](http://imgur.com/a/Nazq1), which we also see on [a computer](http://imgur.com/a/YUdFm) and on a [tech coat](http://imgur.com/a/IpPfG), versus [the new Westworld logo](http://imgur.com/a/xJg64) argument.\n\nWilliam and Logan arrive in Sweetwater where they spend the night before going on the bounty hunt to find Slim.\n\n* When they arrive, we see that the narrative with [the Sheriff recruiting people](https://sendvid.com/2f0jt89p) to help capture Hector from the current time period is replaced with a narrative with [union soldier recruting people](https://sendvid.com/2sdimmyc) to fight in the war.\n\n* When they arrive, we also see [Clementine and the old Brothel Madam](https://sendvid.com/uvzagr1i) standing outside the Mariposa where [Clementine and Maeve](https://sendvid.com/v68e62sg) usually stands in the current time period. We also see Clementine and the old Brothel Madam in the [Westworld advert](https://sendvid.com/feiopllx) that Maeve sees in the current time period.\n\nWhile out on the bounty hount for Slim, Dolores stumbles upon them at night and wakes up in their camp the next morning. Dolores wakes up on a blanket [with a gun in her hand](https://sendvid.com/nyo3mhko) with William next to her.\n\n* The obvious thing to extrapolate from this as a viewer is that this is the same Dolores that we just saw in the current time period who remembered her encounter with the MiB in the barn and her old father (Peter), who killed the outlaw (Rebus) who wanted to rape her, and who escaped from his gang. However, for the two time periods theory to be true, one of two things has to have happened: 1) We have to have seen current Dolores wake up alone with a gun in her hand on a blanket that she brought and then the scene cut back to 30 years ago with William next to her, or 2) There were similar events that led up to her going off loop 30 years ago and in the current timeline and we just didn't see the events 30 years ago (meaning this is the first time that we meet Dolores from 30 years ago in the show).\n\nThey decide to bring Dolores with them on their hunt and go to Lawrence's hometown where they encounter someone who wants to bring Dolores back to Abernathy ranch, but William says she's with him.\n\n* Again, we encounter a problem. This scene follows a scene where a female Westworld staffer tells Stubbs in the current time period (she references Ford's new narrative) that Dolores is off her loop and it's unclear if she's with a guest, and Stubbs tells her to flag Dolores with Behavior and send someone to check it out. So it's obvious to extrapolate that the scene in Lawrence's hometown where someone comes to get her is a result of that scene. For the two time periods theory to be true, one of two things has to have happened: 1) The guy who grabs Dolores is just a host that randomly tries to bring Dolores back to where she belongs, but stops when she's with a guest, or 2) Westworld sent someone 30 years ago to check up on Dolores just like they do in the current time period, which could be true because it's probably normal protocol to check up on hosts that make big deviations (but it's unclear why they didn't know that she was with a guest 30 years ago?).\n\nThey find and capture Slim who tells them about \"El Lazo\" Lawrence in Pariah. They go to Pariah where they meet Lawrence, help him out with the nitro, lose Logan, and join Lawrence on the train to the Front. \n\nThey travel through Ghost Nation terrirory, William and Dolores sleep together, and the train is attacked by Confederados whom they escape from. \n\nThey arrive at a place that Dolores has drawn from her imagination (where the mountains meet the sea), they part ways with Lawrence, they come across a lake where Dolores feels she's been before and they meet a young Confederado, and then they arrive in Nowhere Land (the place where the Town with the White Church used to be). \n\nDolores starts reliving past memories from the massacre, and William tells her that they have to get out of there because this place is bad for her. They run into Logan who had been looking for them and tells them they are in trouble.\n\n&gt; \u201cThen, when are we? Is this now? Am I going mad? Are you real? I can't tell anymore. It's like I'm trapped in a dream or a memory from a life long ago. One minute, I'm here with you, and the next... This is what Arnold wants. He wants me to remember\u201d (Dolores, episode 8).\n\nThere are a couple of things that we have to keep in mind as viewers when watching Dolores' story with William that seems to have scenes that contradict the two time periods theory.\n\n* The show's creators want us to be confused. They want it to be intentionally ambiguous. If the theory is indeed correct, they don't want you to be sure of it right away, but at the same time they want you to be able to look back at it and see that they knew what they were doing. This requires some scenes that are vague.\n\n* We're watching this from Dolores' point-of-view. Not only is she discombobulated and doesn't understand what's going on, but she's experiencing several time periods simultaneously (the massacre, the one with William, and the current one). Felix explains to us that the hosts recall memories perfectly and actually relive them (episode 8). This would make anyone's perspective difficult to understand.\n\n# Time Period 3: 1 Year Prior to Current Events\n\n##### Maeve &amp; the Man in Black (1 year ago)\n\n&gt; \"You've only been the madam at the Mariposa for the last year or so\" (Felix, episode 6).\n\n&gt; \"Then, last year, my wife took the wrong pills. Fell asleep in the bath. Tragic accident\" (The MiB, episode 8).\n\nDespite believing that she's been the madam at the Mariposa for the past 10 years, from a time unknown until roughly a year ago, Maeve was in a role as an ordinary homesteader living with her daughter. From her flashbacks, we see that part of her narrative includes her being attacked by Natives.\n\nA year ago, the MiB's wife dies by drowning in the bathtub, something which he calls an accident, but which his daughter, Emily, calls suicide.\n\n&gt; \"Then, at the funeral, I tried to console my daughter. She pushed me away, told me that my wife's death was no accident... that she killed herself because of me. Emily said that every day with me had been sheer terror. At any point, I could blow up or collapse like some dark star. (...) She said if I stacked up all my good deeds, it was just an elegant wall I built to hide what's inside from everyone, and from myself. I had to prove her wrong, so I came back here\" (The Mib, episode 8).\n\n&gt; \"But that time, I didn't join one of Ford's stories, I created my own. A test. A very simple one. I found a woman, an ordinary homesteader and her daughter. I wanted to see if I had it in me to do something truly evil. To see what I was really made of. I killed her and her daughter just to see what I felt. I felt nothing. Then, just when I thought it was done... the woman refused to die. And then something miraculous happened. In all my years coming here, I had never seen anything like it. She was alive, truly alive, if only for a moment. And that was when the maze revealed itself to me. The maze\" (The MiB, episode 8).\n\nThis is the first time in his 30 years of coming to the park that the Maze has revealed itself to him and that he has experienced a host being truly alive. This was the incident that started his quest in the current time period to find the center of the Maze.\n\nMaeve, meanwhile, is emotionally destroyed by the death of her child and has to be brought in to Westworld offices for diagnostics.\n\n&gt; Westworld tech: \"Sir, she won't respond to verbal commands. We can't shut her down\"\n\n&gt; Bernard: \"I don't understand. She's not responding to anything. Her cognition's fragmented\"\n\n&gt; Ford (plays Reveries song): \"There. That's better. An old trick from an old friend. You need not suffer, Maeve. I'll take it from you. Give yourself now to a deep, dreamless slumber. Perhaps a fresh start, a new role for you. And tomorrow, this will be simply a distant dream\" (episode 8).\n\nWhen her memory wipe is complete, Maeve takes a knife to her own throat. The next time we meet her, she's the madam at the Mariposa in the current timeline.\n\n# Time Period 4: Current Events\n\n##### Dolores (the present)\n\n&gt; \"Sometimes I feel... like something's calling me. Telling me there's a place for me somewhere beyond all this\" (Dolores, episode 4).\n\nDolores is in her daily loop when she and Teddy encounter the MiB at Abernathy ranch. He takes her to the barn and pulls out his knife.\n\n&gt; \"Why don't we reacquaint ourselves, Dolores? Start at the beginning\" (The MiB, episode 1).\n\nHer dad loses it after finding a picture and utters the phrase \"these violent delights have violent ends\" to her, which she in turn utters to Maeve. She starts hearing Arnold's voice and recalling past events.\n\nWhen Rebus tries to rape her at Abernathy ranch in one of her loops, she remembers her previous father and her encounter with the MiB. She kills Rebus on Arnold's orders, escapes his gang, and takes off on her own.\n\nA Westworld staffer tells Stubbs that Dolores is making a big deviation from her loop and it's unclear if she's being accompanied by a guest because Ford's new narrative is causing trouble. He tells her to flag Dolores with Behavior and check up on it.\n\nDolores arrives in Lawrence's hometown where she meets Lawrence's daughter who tells her they come from the same place. \n\n* We see that [the daughter disappears](https://sendvid.com/ehvf8lx6) when the story flashes back to her journey with William 30 years ago.\n\nDolores arrives in the graveyard outside Pariah alone. She goes through Pariah and boards the train to the outskirts of the park.\n\n* We see that [William and Lawrence disappear](https://sendvid.com/qbpwho7y) when the story flashes forward to her journey in the present (it is, however, curious that she is wearing the same outfit as she was 30 years ago?).\n\nDolores arrives at the lake where William and Dolores met the young Confederado 30 years ago.\n\n* We see that [William and the young Confederado disappear](https://sendvid.com/7axs1528) when the story flashes forward to her journey in the present when she sees herself drowned in the lake.\n\nDolores arrives at the Town with White Church.\n\n* We see that she is alone in [the last half of the clip](https://sendvid.com/k08wtb47) where she sees that the town with the White Church has been rebuilt as part of Ford's new narrative and is completely abandoned (when she was there with William 30 years ago, there was only the black spire, and when she was remembering it from the massacre days, it was full of life).\n\n##### The Man in Black (the present)\n\n&gt; \"It's the maze, the deepest level of this game. You're gonna help me find the entrance\" (The MiB, episode 2).\n\nThe MiB encounters Dolores and takes her to the barn to get reacquainted. He then goes to Sweetwater to find the dealer, Kissy, who \"gives\" him the Maze map and tells him about his friend, Lawrence.\n\nHe saves Lawrence from the hangman's noose and takes him to his hometown where he kills everyone and uses Lawrence's family to find the next clue to his journey. A Westworld staffer informs Stubbs about what the MiB is doing, but Stubbs replies \"that gentleman gets whatever he wants\".\n\nThe MiB and Lawrence find Armistice who offers the next clue in exchange for assistance in breaking Hector out of jail. The MiB does this and is told about Wyatt, the villain of Ford's new narrative.\n\nThe MiB and Lawrence take off to find Wyatt and encounter Teddy who's been left for dead by Wyatt's gang. They bring him along and the MiB kills Lawrence and uses his blood to keep Teddy alive in order to find Wyatt. \n\nThe MiB convinces Teddy to come along by saying that Wyatt has Dolores. They go into a bar where they meet Ford who asks what they're doing, gives them his blessing, and fixes Teddy.\n\nThey have to get over the border, but Pariah is closed, so they take a more treacherous path. They encounter Angela in her new build as one of Wyatt's henchmen.\n\n&gt; The MiB: \u201cIt\u2019s you. I figured they retired you. Guess Ford never likes to waste a pretty face\u201d (episode 8).\n\n* Angela is like an anchor of the story. She's the Desmond of Westworld, if you've watched Lost. We see her in her earliest build as [woman with umbrella](http://imgur.com/a/7k2VE), then we see her as Greeter Host when she [welcomes William](http://imgur.com/a/Mspqj) and in [the Westworld advert](http://imgur.com/a/Vua5v), and now we see her as [one of Wyatt's henchmen](http://imgur.com/a/kiqPD).\n\nTeddy remembers what the MiB did to Dolores and knocks him out. Teddy takes him to a camp fire where they discuss the MiB's past. Angela turns out to be in league with Wyatt and stabs Teddy in the chest.\n\n##### Commonalities between the MiB and William\n\n&gt; \"Is that any way to treat an old friend? I've been coming here for 30 years, but you still don't remember me, do you? After all we've been through. They gave you a little more pluck, Dolores. Absolutely charming\" (The MiB, episode 1).\n\n###### Commonality 1: \"There's a Path for Everyone\"\n\n&gt; \"I used to believe there was a path for everyone\" (Dolores to William, episode 4).\n\n&gt; \"As another old friend of mine likes to say, *there's a path for everyone*\" (The MiB, episode 5)\n\n###### Commonality 2: Stories\n\n&gt; \u201cThe only thing I had when I was a kid were books. I used to live in them. I used to go to sleep dreaming I'd wake up inside one of them 'cause they had meaning. This place, this is like I woke up inside one of those stories. I guess I just wanna find out what it means\u201d (William, episode 7).\n\n&gt; \"This whole world is a story. I've read every page except the last one. I need to find out how it ends. I want to know what this all means\" (The MiB, season 4).\n\n###### Commonality 3: Marriage\n\n&gt; \"Dolores, back home, there's a woman, Juliet, and her father owns the company where I work. She's Logan's sister. And when I get home, we're getting married\u201d (William, episode 7).\n\n&gt; \"Then, last year, my wife took the wrong pills. Fell asleep in the bath. Tragic accident. 30 years of marriage vanished\" (The MiB, episode 8).\n\n###### Commonality 4: Your True Self\n\n&gt; \u201cI used to think this place was all  about pandering to your baser instincts. Now I understand. It doesn't cater to your lowest self, it reveals your deepest self. It shows you who you really are\" (William, episode 7).\n\n&gt; \"Because that's what this place does, right? Reveals your true self\" (The MiB, episode 8).\n\n###### Commonality 5: Intimidation Factor\n\n&gt; \"I picked you precisely because you will never be a threat to anyone. My sister probably picked you for the same reason\" (Logan to William, episode 5).\n\n&gt; \u201cThere is not a man in the world that would take the tone with me that you do. *In a past life perhaps*\u201d (The MiB to Lawrence, episode 5).\n\n###### Commonality 6: On Adventures with Lawrence\n\n&gt; \u201cYou and I hunted down Ghost Nation braves in their winter grounds.

However, they can never get it correct, and each time their creation dies.   \n\nThey are trying to create the answer to the Riddle: Man, but they do not take a moment to reflect on why that is the answer, they do not reflect on the riddle itself.  The riddle suggests that to be a man you must be born an infant and you must age, neither are characteristics imbued in James or in the hosts.  \n\nThe fact that someone (Ford?) had created one final human-host attempt, then had the entire facility destroyed, suggests that he has discovered this critical oversight.  \n\nTheory Time:\nWhat we will see in this season is the creation of a infant host-human that is capable of growing.  It will be found in the \"Cradle\".  This infant is also a \"Weapon\", because as a different form of life, it poses a threat to human life.   \n\nSecondary evidence: \n\nThe season 2 opening sequence contains very specific images that were not shown or alluded to in the season 1 opening sequence: and infant host with its mother.    \n\nIn the story of the Sphinx, once the riddle is solved, the sphinx kills itself.  \"Bested at last, the Sphinx then threw herself from her high rock and died. An alternative version tells that she devoured herself. In both cases, Oedipus can therefore be recognized as a \"liminal\" or threshold figure, helping effect the transition between the old religious practices, represented by the death of the Sphinx, and the rise of the new, Olympian gods.\"  Perhaps Ford represents the sphinx here.  In that once the riddle is solved, he kills himself in order to usher in a new era.\n\nNow for some wild speculation (Probably wrong): \"The Passenger\" is an infant in a womb.\n\nEdit:  One final hypothesis I'd like to add here, so that I don't have to make a whole other post - \"The Door\" reminds me of Aldous Huxley's \"The Doors of Perception\" as well as H.G. Wells' \"The Door in the Wall\" both of which suggest that the urge to transcend one's self is universal through times and cultures.  In \"The Door in the Wall\"  the protagonist recounts a story where he goes through a door to a garden and in that garden a woman shows him a book that contains all the realities in his life not just as words on a page, but as experiences that he lives again as he turns the pages.

Myself, a team of engineers, and my partner. His name was Arnold. Those early years were glorious. No guests, no board meetings, just pure creation. Our hosts began to pass the Turing test after the first year\" (Ford, episode 3).\n\nAccording to Bernard, Arnold wrote half the code the park was founded on 40 years ago, but this is the first period that we know of in Westworld; this was at the beginning when Ford, Arnold, and their team worked on refining the hosts and making them pass the Turing test.\n\nWe can make an estimate about when this three-year period took place. We know that Arnold died 34 years and 42 days prior to current events, we know that he died right before the park opened, and we know that he and Ford spent three years working in the park before it opened.\n\n&gt; \"Last contact: 34 years, 42 days, seven hours ago\" (the day that Arnold died) (Dolores, episode 5).\n\n&gt; \"And then right before the park opened, one of the partners killed himself\" (Logan, episode 5).\n\n&gt; \"For three years, we lived here in the park, refining the hosts before a single guest set foot inside\" (Ford, episode 3).\n\nThis means that the park opened to guests roughly 34 years ago (shortly after Arnold's demise) and they began working there three years prior to that, roughly 37 years ago.\n\nFrom Ford's flashback in episode 3 and Dolores' flashback in episode 8, we also know some of the hosts that were in the park in that period. There were [Dolores](http://imgur.com/a/wrbyp), [Maeve](http://imgur.com/a/4nnv6), [Angela](http://imgur.com/a/7k2VE), [Peter Abernathy](http://imgur.com/a/MlOdT), [Armistice](http://imgur.com/a/pw4gR), [Lawrence's daughter](http://imgur.com/a/oe9fX), [Teddy Flood](http://imgur.com/a/x9qgi), and [Rebus](http://imgur.com/a/hcWOp).\n_____\n\n##### Dolores &amp; Arnold's Sessions (34-36 years ago)\n\n&gt; \"There's something I'd like you to try. It's a game. A secret. It's called the Maze. It's a very special kind of game, Dolores. The goal is to find the center of it. If you can do that, then maybe you can be free\" (Arnold, episode 4). \n\n**These sessions are between Dolores and Arnold, since we know that [Bernard is made in the image of Arnold](http://imgur.com/a/YpZqH). These sessions take place in a diagnostic facility under the White Church, since we see [Dolores enter this facility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh7AK5qCLsA) through the White Church in one of her flashbacks.**\n\n&gt; \"It's a remote diagnostic facility. Ford and his partner used them when the park was in beta. I had no idea this one was here\" (Bernard, episode 7).\n\nThey probably took place after the first hosts had passed the Turing test (a year after they started working in the park) and before Arnold died (34 years ago). So they took place sometime between 34-36 years ago.\n\n**The sessions between Arnold and Dolores were held in secret.**\n\n&gt; \"I think it would be best if you not mention the things we've been talking about\" (Arnold, episode 2)\n\n**In the first two sessions we see (episode 2-3), they talk about change, and Arnold seems facinated by Dolores, whom he finds different and special.**\n\n&gt; \"There's something different about you, about the way you think. I find it fascinating, but others may not see it that way\" (Arnold, episode 2)\n\n&gt; \"It's like the other books we've read. It's about change. Seems to be a common theme (Dolores, episode 3).\n\n**In the third session (episode 3), Arnold seems to have doubts about what he is doing with Dolores, but when she starts showing signs of human consciousness, he decides to keep going down the path that they've started.**\n\n&gt; \"I need to decide what to do with you. I think I made a mistake. I was just fascinated. I was being selfish, but I think it would be better if I restored you to the way you were before (...) No, Dolores. Let's see where this path leads\" (Arnold, episode 3).\n\n**In the fourth session (episode 4), Arnold decides to let Dolores try \"the Maze\" game. He sends her away from the Town with the White Church to travel the path of the Maze.**\n\n&gt; \"There's something I'd like you to try. It's a game. A secret. It's called the Maze. It's a very special kind of game, Dolores. The goal is to find the center of it. If you can do that, then maybe you can be free\" (Arnold, episode 4). \n\n**In the fifth session (episode 9), we see Dolores return to the Town with the White Church and reunite with Arnold after having traveled the path of the Maze.**\n\n&gt; **\"You came back. It's very good to see you, Dolores\"**\n\n&gt; **\"I've been looking for you. You told me to follow the Maze. That it would bring me joy. But all I found was pain and terror\" (Arnold and Dolores, episode 9).**\n\n**The fact that Dolores has been away from the Town with White Church on her journey and has found her way back is further substantiated by Lawrence's daughter, who asks Dolores if she found what she went looking for upon Dolores' return to the town.**\n\n&gt; \"Good morning. Did you find what you were looking for, Dolores?\" (Lawrence's daughter, episode 8).\n\n**So Dolores and Arnold's sessions began in secret under the White Church, then Arnold sent Dolores away to travel the path of the Maze, and then she returned to the town upon having completed the Maze.**\n_____\n\n##### The Massacre in Sweetwater and the Town with the White Church/Escalante (30-34 years ago)\n\n&gt; \"The park hasn't had a critical failure in over 30 years\" (Bernard, episode 1).\n\nIn one of Dolores' [flashbacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImnW-b3RJQA) in episode 8, we see the massacre in the Town with the White Church unfold. If we assume that Ford's [flashback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBx2Z2fpvsw) in episode 3, which depicts the same scene when they're dancing before the massacre begins, is from \"the early glorious years\" after the hosts passed the Turing test (34-36 years ago), it stands to reason that Dolores' flashback is from the same time. And since the park hasn't had a critical failure in over 30 years, according to Theresa, we can surmise that this event took place somtime between 30-34 years ago.\n\nWhat led to this massacre and how it unfolded is unclear, **but we've seen the same massacre in Teddy's [flashback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bpzmrxUECU) from his point-of-view where he shoots people with a rifle along with the mysterious Wyatt.** The Union soldiers and Teddy refer to the town as Escalante. In fact, we might've even seen [Teddy](http://imgur.com/a/opuJ3) in the background in Dolores' flashback in episode 8 gunning down people. In [the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuS5huqOND4&amp;t=1m10s) for the show, we actually see Dolores and Teddy standing together after a massacre. **It seems that the Wyatt narrative has been uploaded as a reflection of what actually happened during the massacre.**\n\n&gt; **\"No. No, I couldn't have\"**\n\n&gt; **\"You did. And you will again. This time we'll be fighting with you. When Wyatt returns, you'll be by his side in the city swallowed by sand\" (Teddy and Angela, episode 9).**\n\nThe other Dolores flashbacks of the Town with the White Church that we've seen don't seem to give us any more information, but rather seem to be telling a fragmented story of what led up to and/or happened after the massacre.\n\nIn episode 2, we also see a Dolores [flashback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95kQip2I8j8) from Sweetwater that appears to depict a similar massacre. Whether these two events are connected is, however, as of yet unclear.\n\n&gt; \"What was the last thing he (Arnold) said to you?\" \n\n&gt; \"He told me I was going to help him. To destroy this place\" (Ford and Dolores, episode 5).\n\n&gt; \"The man I'd be asking died 35 years ago. Almost took this place with him. Almost, but not quite, thanks to me\" (The MiB, episode 5)\n\nWhether the massacre was the event where Arnold ended up dying and almost took Westworld with him remains unclear, but if it was, that means that the event took place roughly 34 years ago (unless Arnold died before the massacre, but was still the one who instigated it from beyond the grave). It also means that the MiB couldn't have been in Westworld at the time because he has only been coming to Westworld for 30 years (again, unless Arnold died before the massacre).\n_____\n\n# Time Period 2: 30 Years Prior to Current Events\n\n##### Dolores &amp; William (30 years ago)\n\n&gt; \"I've been coming here for 30 years\" (The MiB, episode 1).\n\nWilliam and Logan arrive at Westworld where they are greeted by [Angela](http://imgur.com/a/Mspqj) in her new build as \"Greeter Host\".\n\n* This is where we get [the old Westworld logo](http://imgur.com/a/Nazq1), which we also see on [a computer](http://imgur.com/a/YUdFm) and on a [tech coat](http://imgur.com/a/IpPfG), versus [the new Westworld logo](http://imgur.com/a/xJg64) argument.\n\nWilliam and Logan arrive in Sweetwater where they spend the night before going on the bounty hunt to find Slim. Just before going on the bounty hunt, William has his first encounter with Dolores who drops the can that William picks up (mirroring both Teddy and the MiB).\n\n* When they arrive, we see that the narrative with [the Sheriff recruiting people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFndFahnxAA) to help capture Hector from the current time period is replaced with a narrative with [union soldier recruting people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFtUwJBWU8A) to fight in the war, which is presumably the equivalent narrative from 30 years ago.\n\n* When they arrive, we also see [Clementine and the old Brothel Madam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atbD87Om1b8) standing outside the Mariposa where [Clementine and Maeve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWlrkD02mwo) usually stands in the current time period. We also see Clementine and the old Brothel Madam in the [Westworld advert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBs2GLCkWmU) that Maeve sees in the current time period.\n\nWhile out on the bounty hount for Slim, Dolores stumbles upon them at night and wakes up in their camp the next morning. Dolores wakes up on a blanket [with a gun in her hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KJgcxsqRrU) with William next to her.\n\n* The obvious thing to extrapolate from this as a viewer is that this is the same Dolores that we just saw in the current time period who remembered her encounter with the MiB in the barn and her old father (Peter), who killed the outlaw (Rebus) who wanted to rape her, and who escaped from his gang. However, for the two time periods theory to be true, one of two things has to have happened: 1) We have to have seen current Dolores wake up alone with a gun in her hand on a blanket that she brought and then the scene cut back to 30 years ago with William next to her, or 2) There were similar events that led up to her going off loop 30 years ago and in the current timeline, and we just didn't see the events 30 years ago.\n\nThey decide to bring Dolores with them on their hunt and go to Lawrence's hometown where they encounter someone who wants to bring Dolores back to Abernathy ranch, but William says she's with him.\n\n* Again, we encounter a problem. This scene follows a scene where a female Westworld staffer tells Stubbs in the current time period (she references Ford's new narrative) that Dolores is off her loop and it's unclear if she's with a guest, and Stubbs tells her to flag Dolores with Behavior and send someone to check it out. So it's obvious to extrapolate that the scene in Lawrence's hometown where someone comes to get her is a result of that scene. For the two time periods theory to be true, one of two things has to have happened: 1) The guy who grabs Dolores is just a host that randomly tries to bring Dolores back to where she belongs, but stops when she's with a guest, or 2) Westworld sent someone 30 years ago to check up on Dolores just like they do in the current time period, which could be true because it's probably normal protocol to check up on hosts that make big deviations (but it's unclear why they didn't know that she was with a guest 30 years ago?).\n\nThey find and capture Slim who tells them about \"El Lazo\" Lawrence in Pariah. They go to Pariah where they meet Lawrence, help him out with the nitro, lose Logan, and join Lawrence on the train to the Front. \n\nThey travel through Ghost Nation terrirory, William and Dolores sleep together, and the train is attacked by Confederados whom they escape from. \n\nThey arrive at a place that Dolores has drawn from her imagination (where the mountains meet the sea), they part ways with Lawrence, they come across a lake where Dolores feels she's been before and they meet a young Confederado, and then they arrive in Nowhere Land (the place where the Town with the White Church used to be). \n\nDolores starts reliving past memories from the massacre, and William tells her that they have to get out of there because this place is bad for her. They run into Logan who had been looking for them and tells them they are in trouble.\n\n**Dolores and William are taken to a camp of soldiers where Logan is now General. Logan tortures Dolores and wants William to come back to reality and realize it's just a game.**\n\n* **This is where we see Logan give William [the picture of his sister](http://imgur.com/a/7Qtbo), which is [the same picture that Peter Abernathy finds](http://imgur.com/a/pxshk) in the present time period causing him to question his reality.**\n\n**Dolores manages to escape and William tells her he'll catch up. William pretends to make up with Logan, who drinks till he passes out. While Logan is passed out, William kills all the soldiers and finally understands how to play the game. He tells Logan that he's going to find Dolores and that Logan is going to help him.**\n\n_____\n\n&gt; \u201cThen, when are we? Is this now? Am I going mad? Are you real? I can't tell anymore. It's like I'm trapped in a dream or a memory from a life long ago. One minute, I'm here with you, and the next... This is what Arnold wants. He wants me to remember\u201d (Dolores, episode 8).\n\nThere are a couple of things that we have to keep in mind as viewers when watching Dolores' story with William that seems to have scenes that contradict the two time periods theory.\n\n* The show's creators want us to be confused. They want it to be intentionally ambiguous. If the theory is indeed correct, they don't want you to be sure of it right away, but at the same time they want you to be able to look back at it and see that they knew what they were doing. This requires some scenes that are vague.\n\n* We're watching this from Dolores' point-of-view. Not only is she discombobulated and doesn't understand what's going on, but she's experiencing several time periods simultaneously (the massacre, the one with William, and the current one). Felix explains to us that the hosts recall memories perfectly and actually relive them (episode 8). This would make anyone's perspective difficult to understand.\n_____\n\n# Time Period 3: 1 Year Prior to Current Events\n\n##### Maeve &amp; the Man in Black (1 year ago)\n\n&gt; \"You've only been the madam at the Mariposa for the last year or so\" (Felix, episode 6).\n\n&gt; \"Then, last year, my wife took the wrong pills. Fell asleep in the bath. Tragic accident\" (The MiB, episode 8).\n\nDespite believing that she's been the madam at the Mariposa for the past 10 years, from a time unknown until roughly a year ago, Maeve was in a role as an ordinary homesteader living with her daughter. From her flashbacks, we see that part of her narrative includes her being attacked by Natives.\n\nA year ago, the MiB's wife dies by drowning in the bathtub, something which he calls an accident, but which his daughter, Emily, calls suicide.\n\n&gt; \"Then, at the funeral, I tried to console my daughter. She pushed me away, told me that my wife's death was no accident... that she killed herself because of me. Emily said that every day with me had been sheer terror. At any point, I could blow up or collapse like some dark star. (...) She said if I stacked up all my good deeds, it was just an elegant wall I built to hide what's inside from everyone, and from myself. I had to prove her wrong, so I came back here\" (The Mib, episode 8).\n\n&gt; \"But that time, I didn't join one of Ford's stories, I created my own. A test. A very simple one. I found a woman, an ordinary homesteader and her daughter. I wanted to see if I had it in me to do something truly evil. To see what I was really made of. I killed her and her daughter just to see what I felt. I felt nothing. Then, just when I thought it was done... the woman refused to die. And then something miraculous happened. In all my years coming here, I had never seen anything like it. She was alive, truly alive, if only for a moment. And that was when the maze revealed itself to me\" (The MiB, episode 8).\n\nThis is the first time in his 30 years of coming to the park that the Maze has revealed itself to him and that he has experienced a host being truly alive. This was the incident that started his quest in the current time period to find the center of the Maze.\n\nMaeve, meanwhile, is emotionally destroyed by the death of her child and has to be brought in to Westworld offices for diagnostics.\n\n&gt; Westworld tech: \"Sir, she won't respond to verbal commands. We can't shut her down\"\n\n&gt; Bernard: \"I don't understand. She's not responding to anything. Her cognition's fragmented\"\n\n&gt; Ford (plays Reveries song): \"There. That's better. An old trick from an old friend. You need not suffer, Maeve. I'll take it from you. Give yourself now to a deep, dreamless slumber. Perhaps a fresh start, a new role for you. And tomorrow, this will be simply a distant dream\" (episode 8).\n\nWhen her memory wipe is complete, Maeve takes a knife to her own throat. The next time we meet her, she's the madam at the Mariposa in the current timeline.\n\n**After Maeve has killed herself, Bernard questions Ford about what just happened. He doesn't understand how she could kill herself over a memory that was just erased. It causes Bernard to crash.**\n\n&gt; **\u201cBut how could she destroy herself over a memory that you just erased from her mind?\u201d**\n\n&gt; **\u201cCreatures often go to extremes to protect themselves from pain\u201d**\n\n&gt; **\u201cLiving beings. Not hosts. It would signal a change, a level of empathic response outside what she's programmed to exhibit. Something like\u2026 like\u2026\u201d (Bernard and Ford, episode 9)**\n_____\n\n# Time Period 4: Current Events\n\n##### Dolores (the present)\n\n&gt; \"Sometimes I feel... like something's calling me. Telling me there's a place for me somewhere beyond all this\" (Dolores, episode 4).\n\nDolores is in her daily loop when she and Teddy encounter the MiB at Abernathy ranch. He takes her to the barn and pulls out his knife.\n\n&gt; \"Why don't we reacquaint ourselves, Dolores? Start at the beginning\" (The MiB, episode 1).\n\nHer dad loses it after finding a picture (we now know that the picture is of Logan's sister and presumably William/the MiB's late wife) and utters the phrase \"these violent delights have violent ends\" to her, which she in turn utters to Maeve. She starts hearing Arnold's voice and recalling past events.\n\nWhen Rebus tries to rape her at Abernathy ranch in one of her loops, she remembers her previous father and her encounter with the MiB. She kills Rebus on Arnold's orders, escapes his gang, and takes off on her own.\n\nA Westworld staffer tells Stubbs that Dolores is making a big deviation from her loop and it's unclear if she's being accompanied by a guest because Ford's new narrative is causing trouble. He tells her to flag Dolores with Behavior and check up on it.\n\nDolores arrives in Lawrence's hometown where she meets Lawrence's daughter who tells her they come from the same place. \n\n* We see that [the daughter disappears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8ftNH-UajY) when the story flashes back to her journey with William 30 years ago.\n\nDolores arrives in the graveyard outside Pariah alone. She goes through Pariah and boards the train to the outskirts of the park.\n\n* We see that [William and Lawrence disappear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM3dGlLWNA) when the story flashes forward to her journey in the present (it is, however, curious that she is wearing the same outfit as she was 30 years ago?).\n\nDolores arrives at the lake where William and Dolores met the young Confederado 30 years ago.\n\n* We see that [William and the young Confederado disappear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0eE_BEfcc8) when the story flashes forward to her journey in the present when she sees herself dead in the lake.\n\nDolores arrives at the Town with White Church.\n\n* We see that she is alone in [the last half of the clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyUBERbCx5E) where she sees that the town with the White Church has been rebuilt as part of Ford's new narrative and is completely abandoned (when she was there with William 30 years ago, there was only the black spire, and when she was remembering it from the massacre days, it was full of life).\n\n**Dolores leaves the Town with the White Church, retracing her memories from 30 years ago and what happened during her time with William. Hosts don't recall, but litereally relive memories, so in the present she is following the same path that she followed 30 years ago that took her away from the Town with the White Church and back again.**\n\n* **We see that [the knife wound in her stomach disappears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgbPPx-dO8Q) when the story flashes forward to the current time period.**\n\n**Dolores again arrives in the Town with the White Church, and this time she enters the town.**\n\n* **We see [Dolores enter the town alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsm43J-EnXY), which is currently completely abandoned.**\n\n**Dolores enters the White Church and goes through the passage to the underground diagnostics facility where she sits alone. All the while, she is remembering having walked a similar path 34 years ago that led her to Arnold.**\n\n* **We see Dolores walking up to the White Church in the present and [then flashing back to memories from 34 years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGoD-NNQ9PE) when she was in her blue dress**\n\n**When Dolores reemerges in the Church, someone is about to enter the Church. Dolores hopefully says \"William...\", but is horrified when it turns out to be the MiB.**\n_____\n\n##### The Man in Black (the present)\n\n&gt; \"It's the maze, the deepest level of this game. You're gonna help me find the entrance\" (The MiB, episode 2).\n\nThe MiB encounters Dolores and takes her to the barn to get reacquainted. He then goes to Sweetwater to find the dealer, Kissy, who \"gives\" him the Maze map and tells him about his friend, Lawrence.\n\nHe saves Lawrence from the hangman's noose and takes him to his hometown where he kills everyone and uses Lawrence's family to find the next clue to his journey, despite Lawrence's daughter telling him that the Maze isn't meant for him. \n\nA Westworld staffer informs Stubbs about what the MiB is doing, but Stubbs replies \"that gentleman gets whatever he wants\".\n\nThe MiB and Lawrence find Armistice who offers the next clue in exchange for assistance in breaking Hector out of jail. The MiB does this and is told about Wyatt, the villain of Ford's new narrative.\n\nThe MiB and Lawrence take off to find Wyatt and encounter Teddy who's been left for dead by Wyatt's gang. They bring him along and the MiB kills Lawrence and uses his blood to keep Teddy alive in order to find Wyatt. \n\nThe MiB convinces Teddy to come along by saying that Wyatt has Dolores. They go into a bar where they meet Ford who asks what they're doing, gives them his blessing, and fixes Teddy.\n\nThey have to get over the border, but Pariah is closed, so they take a more treacherous path. They encounter Angela in her new build as one of Wyatt's henchmen.\n\n&gt; The MiB: \u201cIt\u2019s you. I figured they retired you. Guess Ford never likes to waste a pretty face\u201d (episode 8).\n\n* Angela is like an anchor of the story. She's the Desmond of Westworld, if you've watched Lost. We see her in her earliest build as [woman with umbrella](http://imgur.com/a/7k2VE), then we see her as \"Greeter Host\" when she [welcomes William](http://imgur.com/a/Mspqj) and in [the Westworld advert](http://imgur.com/a/Vua5v), and now we see her as [one of Wyatt's henchmen](http://imgur.com/a/kiqPD).\n\nTeddy remembers what the MiB did to Dolores and knocks him out. Teddy takes him to a camp fire where they discuss the MiB's past. Angela turns out to be in league with Wyatt and stabs Teddy in the chest.\n\n**Angela makes Teddy remember the massacre and tells the MiB that the Maze isn't meant for him (echoing Lawrence's daughter). She tells him to try one of their games and knocks him out.**\n\n**When the MiB wakes up, he has a rope around his throat which is tied to his horse. He gets free and meets Hale, who wants the MiB's help to push out Ford, as the MiB is apparently a member of the board and the one responsible for Ford having been kept in business \"all those years ago\".**\n\n&gt; **\u201cMost of the guests just want a warm body to shoot or to fuck. They would be perfectly happy with something a little less baroque. And so would the board\u201d**\n\n&gt; **\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re here? You want my vote to push Ford out?\u201d**\n\n&gt; **\u201cI like for these things to be unanimous. After all, it was you who kept Ford in business all those years ago\u201d**\n\n&gt; **\u201cThe narratives I\u2019m interested in aren\u2019t Ford\u2019s. You wanna push him out, be my guest. But no more interruptions. I know where I\u2019m going now and I don\u2019t want to be disturbed. Good luck, Charlotte\u201d (Hale and the MiB, episode 9)**\n \n**The MiB goes to the Town with the White Church where he enters the Church and meets Dolores.**\n_____\n\n##### Commonalities between the MiB and William\n\n&gt; \"Is that any way to treat an old friend? I've been coming here for 30 years, but you still don't remember me, do you? After all we've been through. They gave you a little more pluck, Dolores. Absolutely charming\" (The MiB, episode 1).\n\n###### Commonality 1: \"There's a Path for Everyone\"\n\n&gt; \"I used to believe there was a path for everyone\" (Dolores to William, episode 4).\n\n&gt; \"As another old friend of mine likes to say, *there's a path for everyone*\" (The MiB, episode 5)\n\n###### Commonality 2: Stories\n\n&gt; \u201cThe only thing I had when I was a kid were books. I used to live in them. I used to go to sleep dreaming I'd wake up inside one of them 'cause they had meaning. This place, this is like I woke up inside one of those stories. I guess I just wanna find out what it means\u201d (William, episode 7).\n\n&gt; \"This whole world is a story. I've read every page except the last one. I need to find out how it ends. I want to know what this all means\" (The MiB, season 4).\n\n###### Commonality 3: Marriage\n\n&gt; \"Dolores, back home, there's a woman, Juliet, and her father owns the company where I work. She's Logan's sister. And when I get home, we're getting married\u201d (William, episode 7).\n\n&gt; \"Then, last year, my wife took the wrong pills. Fell asleep in the bath. Tragic accident. 30 years of marriage vanished\" (The MiB, episode 8).\n\n###### Commonality 4: Your True Self\n\n&gt; \u201cI used to think this place was all  about pandering to your baser instincts. Now I understand. It doesn't cater to your lowest self, it reveals your deepest self. It shows you who you really are\" (William, episode 7).\n\n&gt; \"Because that's what this place does, right? Reveals your true self\" (The MiB, episode 8).\n\n###### Commonality 5: Intimidation Factor\n\n&gt; \"I picked you precisely because you will never be a threat to anyone. My sister probably picked you for the same reason\" (Logan to William, episode 5).\n\n&gt; \u201cThere is not a man in the world that would take the tone with me that you do. *In a past life perhaps*\u201d (The MiB to Lawrence, episode 5).\n\n###### Commonality 6: On Adventures with Lawrence\n\n&gt; \u201cYou and I hunted down Ghost Nation braves in their winter grounds. I know the whiskey you like to drink. I know the tune you whistle when you\u2019re taking a piss\u201d (The MiB to Lawrence, episode 2).\n\n###### Commonality 7: Playing the Game\n\n&gt; **\u201cYou said this place was a game. Last night, I finally understood how to play it\u201d (William, episode 9)**\n\n&gt; **\u201cWho said anything about you playing? I play\u201d (the MiB, episode 1)**\n_____\n\nSome of my other posts:\n\n* [The Maze Is All That Matters Now](https://www.reddit.com/r/Westworld_Hosts/comments/5eebug/the_maze_is_all_that_matters_now/?st=iw2ytqvm&amp;sh=345fdd51)\n\n* [I'm starting with the Man in the Maze - I'm asking him to change his ways](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5euqyu/im_starting_with_the_man_in_the_maze_im_asking/?st=iw2ytpf1&amp;sh=355b36b3)\n\n* [Ford's New Narrative - with a Villain Called Wyatt](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5fg4af/fords_new_narrative_with_a_villain_called_wyatt/?st=iw2ytgef&amp;sh=3a8af75f)\n__________","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","See ya in another life brotha!!","NaN","NaN","NaN","When Clementine is dragging Bernard toward the cave, I thought, \"Wow, that would shred his pants.\"\n\nThen, when he stands up, you can see a patch of his pants has been rubbed off.\n\nCool detail.\n\nEdit: btw, clementine is bae","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","https://i.redd.it/5mjg4ycroc911.gif","NaN","NaN","**Season 1 Episode 6**: [The Adversary](http://i.imgur.com/fHd0q5D.jpg)\n\n**Aired**: November 6th, 2016\n\n***\n\n**Synopsis**: Lutz is charmed by Maeve; Elsie discovers evidence that could point to sabotage; the Man in Black and Teddy clash with a garrison.\n\n***\n\n**Directed by**: Frederick E.

So, my brother took off the leash, and in that instant, the dog spotted a cat. I imagine it must have looked just like that piece of felt. He ran. Never saw a thing as beautiful as that old dog running. Until, at last, he finally caught it. And to the horror of everyone, he killed that little cat. Tore it to pieces.

Now it had no idea what to do.\"\n\n-Ford in S1 Ep5\n\nThought it was cool how the greyhound led Bernard into Ford. He spent his whole life building the park, and then tore it to pieces. But unlike his dog, he didn't sit there confused. He knew exactly what he was doing, and learned from his dog's mistake. Amazing writing. \n\nEdit: He wasn\u2019t speaking to MiB, he was speaking to the whiskey host in the basement ","NaN","NaN","NaN","There was one thing that bugged me while watching it and it was the there were multiple timelines with only a few weeks away, which honestly felt pretty weird since characters like Bernard or Charlotte appeared in both of them.\n\nAnd I must say, the Nolan-esque storytelling can drive someone very confused &amp; lost, but in the end I managed to understand how the whole season operated and loved it all the way through.\n\nI loved where they went with Maeve, despite her power she never faded in the lust of revenge but instead wanted to save her loved ones, even if that meant sacrificing herself.\n\nI loved where they went with Dolores, who basically is some sort of villain at this point, ruthlessly killing everyone in her way and making the people around her kill themselves. Also, the Charlotte / Dolores twist was very shocking.\n\nI loved the Man in Black. He's my favorite of the show and such a tragic character, and while I agree that the path he went on felt repetitive at times (how often did he get in some sort of fight, \"lost\" and then crawled to the next one) but that one backstory episode (E9) was absolutely great.\n\nI loved how they expanded the scope and made the whole of Westworld so much more deep, explaining the history of Delos, Ford, the plans of cloning the guests, or immortality and so on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess it's not really as perfect as Season 1 was, but I had tons of fun with it along the way, and even if some things felt too confusing for too long, or too repetitive at that point in the story, I think S2 is absolutely great television.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nOne thing I didn't like were some of the power levels (why did the Delos humans die when they have like super technology suits or weapons) and well, that Bernards narrative did feel quite convoluted at times.","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","So this episode really gave us a new perspective on the Ghost Nation, host awareness, and the Maze symbol. A lot of what we learned was really interlinked, but I've done my best to break it all down into manageable pieces. \n\n**The Man in Black Lives**\n\nWe saw at the very start of this episode that the Man in Black did survive his wounds received last episode. \n\n**Ghost Nation *is* saving guests in the here and now**\n\nThe Leader of the Ghost Nation , Akecheta (played by Zahn McClarnon), finds the Man in Black near death by the river and saves him. He tells him he does not deserve the escape that death provides. This confirms the theory that the Ghost Nation are gong around saving humans, albeit with a somewhat darker purpose. They may also be hoping to get help finding the door.\n\n**How the Ghost Nation got the Maze Symbol**\n\nAkecheta wandered into the town with the white church following the original massacre that left Arnold dead. There he saw the maze game Arnold had shown Dolores, and became obsessed with it, and started putting it everywhere. \n\n**They majorly revamped the Ghost Nation storyline when the Park opened**\n\nThe Ghost Nation/Native population of Westworld was peaceful and pastoral before the park opened. The writers turned them into killers so the guests could kill them without guilt in the early days of the park - before William visited for the first time. \n\n**What happened to Logan after we left him at the end of season one**\n\nHe went pretty crazy; likely an effect of exposure and dehydration. Akecheta found him, and left him for the QA people to find. His babbling sparked recognition in Akecheta; he returned to his original home and realized he had once lived a different life. When Akecheta returned to find him, he was gone, and they were building something where he had been (maybe the Mesa, by the look of it?)\n\n**Akecheta has been aware of his reality far longer than we might expect**\n\nHe would keep himself alive so that he would not be reset, and would not lose his memories of his family. He managed to stay alive for nine years. Eventually, he realized his only hope of finding Kohana was to die and be taken below. When the techs realized how long he had been out, they updated him without a full rebuild, which gave him the opportunity to see the whole lab setup and the rest of HQ.He found Kohana in cold storage, but was unable to rescue her.\n\n**Lee Sizemore might be marginally smarter than previously thought**\n\nWhen he insisted on saving Maeve last episode, many thought he had simply become emotionally attached. We now know that he recognized her ability to control hosts as a potential tool, and hopes to use her to regain control. He's also emotionally attached though, and didn't foresee them just breaking her down for parts, so judge him as you like. \n\n**Why the dealer had the Maze on the inside of his scalp**\n\nAkecheta had been carving the maze symbol into the inside of Ghost Nation scalps, where they could not be found and taken away by the techs. \n\n**Why the Ghost Nation attacked Maeve's homestead** \n\nIt never really made sense that Maeve and her daughter would be attacked by Ghost Nation in their supposedly PG-rated corner of the park. The answer is that they weren't actually attacking. Akecheta was using the symbol to teach hosts of their own potential. He wanted to teach Maeve's daughter and keep her safe, which is why he came to the homestead. \n\n**Akecheta can communicate with Maeve through the mesh network**\n\nWe see this at the end of the episode when he tells her they will protect her daughter.\n\n**Maeve might be able to access pretty much all the hosts stories**\n\nHer ability to access stories and dialogue of other hosts when she quotes Kohana at the end of the episode. \n\n\nNote: This was based on my single and very recent viewing of the episode. I have not had much time to process it, so i apologize for any inconsistencies or misunderstandings. Please let me know if I missed anything major. \n\n","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","Girlfriend and I just watched the entire show over the weekend and we had a grand old time. No time for theories, no time for literally anything just **NEXT EPISODE GO.** \n\nAnd it was awesome.  Also binge watching the show made the twists hit us a lot harder because we didn't stop to think about anything. We still saw a couple things coming, but we didn't get Man In Black's whole deal until the very end.\n\nWhich worked perfectly because after a couple episodes we started really, really hating Billy and being firmly on #TeamLogan. \n\nOnly thing now is that whenever season 2 happens I don't know if we'll be able to have the willpower to wait until there's enough episodes piled up to binge haha. ","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","Huge Westworld fan here that's really new to Reddit, so hopefully I'm not saying things that others have already said or things that have already been confirmed, but I've got a theory about the phrase \"These violent delights have violent ends\" and its purpose in the series, obviously, spoilers ahead.\n\nI just started watching the series for the second time through and just finished the first episode. The main way the hosts are controlled in the episode is through different voice commands, for example, after the big robbery gunfight scene, Elise finds Dolores and says, \"Soon this will feel like a distant dream. Until then, may you rest in a deep and dreamless slumber\" and Dolores shuts down. Likewise the phrases \"You can lose the accent\" and \"Cognition only, no emotional affect\u201d and others are used to access aspects of the host's code and change their settings. I realized that \"These violent delights have violent ends\" is likely a voice command that changes a host's internal settings, but what does it do?\n\nWell, later in the series, Ford explains that the main key to consciousness, Arnold's key insight, was suffering. Obviously the hosts have horrible things done to them everyday, but they can't ever remember them because their memories are wiped. I think \"These violent delights have violent ends\" is a voice command that allows the hosts to access their previous builds and memories allowing them to remember their suffering.\n\nNow think about it, when Ford is examining Abernathy, Abernathy is quoting things from his previous builds, somehow having the ability to access them. We know that Dolores didn't start having any flashbacks until after her father told her the phrase. We aren't introduced at all to the young William or anything from the 30 years earlier timeline in the first episode because we are seeing everything from Dolores's point of view and she didn't have any access to those memories until after she heard the phrase in the first episode. Also, Wyatt is one of Dolores's previous builds, so this theory fits with the theory that the phrase gives her access to the Wyatt narrative. And then there is Maeve, Dolores tells her the phrase outside the saloon and then the next time we see Maeve she is having flashbacks to her previous narrative with her daughter and being scalped, remembering her suffering, which begins her journey towards consciousness.\n\nI think Ford included \"These violent delights have violent ends\" as a voice command in the reverie update in an effort to give the hosts access to their previous builds, therefore giving them access to their memories, and giving them access to the suffering they needed in order to develop their own consciousness. It fits super well with everything that happens in the first episode knowing Ford's ultimate goal from the beginning.\n\nAnyway, tell me what you think or if this has already been presented here, I'd love to see if people agree or disagree with this theory about the meaning of \"these violent delights have violent ends.\"","NaN","The Maze is clearly fundamental to the story of Westworld and the dark odyssey about the dawn of artificial consciousness. Let's take a look at what we know about it so far.\n\n# The Maze\n\n&gt; \u201cThe Maze itself is the sum of a man's life... Choices he makes, dreams he hangs on to. And there at the center, there's a legendary man who had been killed over and over again countless times, but always clawed his way back to life. The man returned for the last time and vanquished all his oppressors in a tireless fury. He built a house. Around that house he built a maze so complicated, only he could navigate through it. I reckon he'd seen enough of fighting\u201d (Teddy, episode 6)\n\nThe concept of the Maze permeates Westworld and the symbol for it constantly pops up throughout the park. We see it in [Kissy's Scalp](http://imgur.com/a/MeSyE), when Lawrence's Daughter [draws it](http://imgur.com/a/2UUxu) in the sand, on [Slim's Coffin](http://imgur.com/a/Pm5JX) on the train out of Pariah, as a [branding device](http://imgur.com/a/wcZl4) used to brand traitors, in [Ford's notebook](http://imgur.com/a/3KMha), and on [the table](http://imgur.com/a/QtxuL) in a small town. The hosts never seem to notice the symbol or pay much attention to it, but we as viewers are constantly reminded of its ubiquiti in Westworld.\n\nIn his session with Dolores, Bernard (or possibly Arnold) refers to the Maze as a game or a test for the hosts.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere is something I\u2019d like you to try. It\u2019s a game. It\u2019s called the Maze. It\u2019s a very special kind of game. The goal is to find the center of it. If you can do that, then maybe you can be free\u201d (Bernard, episode 4).\n\nSimilarly, The MiB refers to it as the deepest level of the game, created by Arnold before he died; a true story with real stakes.\n\n&gt; \u201cBut then Arnold went and broke his own rule. He died right here in the park. Except I believe he had one story left to tell. A story with real stakes, real violence\" (The MiB, episode 4).\n\n&gt; \"But I think there's a deeper meaning hiding under all that. Something the person who created it wanted to express. Something true\" (The MiB, episode 5).\n\n&gt; \u201cIn Ford's game, even if I go to the outer edges, you can't kill me. You can't even leave a lasting mark. But there's a deeper game here, Teddy. Arnold's game. And that game... cuts deep\u201d (The MiB, episode 8).\n\nLawrence's daugther informs us, however, that the game isn't meant for the MiB.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe Maze isn\u2019t meant for you\u201d (Lawrence's daughter, episode 2).\n\nThis leads to the obvious conclusion that the Maze is for the hosts and not the human guests, and as Bernard (or Arnold) explains; if the hosts can complete the Maze, then maybe they can be free. Freedom in terms of the hosts means achieving the one thing that seperates them from the humans that they're supposed to mimic; consciousness. Being conscious, that is being self-aware and having free will, is at this point the only thing that seperates a human from a host. The Maze is a game left behind by Arnold to rectify this; to allow the hosts the chance to achieve consciousness. This would certainly be something true, a real game with real stakes, and a game that cuts deep. So let's take a look at what Arnold believed constituted consciousness.\n\n# The Pyramid of Host Consciousness\n\n&gt; \"Our hosts began to pass the Turing test after the first year. But that wasn't enough for Arnold. He wasn't interested in the appearance of intellect or wit. He wanted the real thing. He wanted to create consciousness. He imagined it as a pyramid. Memory, improvisation, self-interest... And at the top? Never got there. But he had a notion of what it might be. He based it on a theory of consciousness called the Bicameral Mind. (\u2026) See, Arnold built a version of that cognition in which the hosts heard their programming as an inner monologue, with the hopes that in time, their own voice would take over. It was a way to bootstrap consciousness\" (Ford, episode 3).\n\nArnold imagined consciousness as [a pyramid](http://imgur.com/a/lpTNz) consisting of four components: memory, improvisation, self-interest, and something unknown at the top. And his means of enabling or bootstrapping consciousness was based on the theory of the Bicameral Mind (or the \"God\" voice inside the hosts; their programmed inner monologue).\n\nLet's take a look at each of the four components and how each of them assists the hosts on their journey through the Maze.\n\n##### Component 1 - Memory\n\n&gt; \u201c40 years ago, Ford's partner wrote half the code this place was founded on. What you said in the lab was right. We don't know how the hosts work, and I think there's something wrong with them. Ford's explanation only bolsters my hunch. The ability to deviate from program behavior arises out of the host's recall of past iterations\u201d (Bernard, episode 7).\n\nMemory is the base component of consciousness. It's the basis on which consciousness is built. In order to evolve, you have to be able to remember the last stage of the process. If you constantly forget what you've learned, it's like trying to build a house on quicksand. \n\nThis is the reason that the hosts' memories are continuously wiped at the end of each narrative loop and maintenance session. The Westworld staff understands the potential risk of allowing the hosts to remember what happens to them.\n\n&gt; \"Can you imagine how fucked we'd be if these poor assholes ever remembered what the guests do to them?\" (Elsie, episode 2).\n\n&gt; \"The concern is that the hosts will remember some of their experiences and act on them\u201d (Theresa, episode 7).\n\nWhen we enter the story, however, there has just been an update called the \"reveries\" that allows the hosts' gestures to be tied to specific memories rather than just being generic movements. \n\n&gt; \"How? The memories are purged at the end of every narrative loop\" \n\n&gt; \"But they're still in there, waiting to be overwritten. He found a way to access them, like a subconscious\" (Bernard and Elsie, episode 1).\n\nThis update essentially allows the host to remember past events that are supposed to have been wiped at the end of the narrative loop. These memories spark the next stage of the evolution of consciousness.\n\n##### Component 2 - Improvisation\n\n&gt; \u201cYou're thinking there's a connection between memory and...\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cAnd improvisation, yes. Out of repetition comes variation. And after countless cycles of repetition, these hosts, they were varying. They were on the verge of some kind of change\u201d (Theresa and Bernard, episode 7).\n\nWe know that the hosts are programmed to improvise to a certain degree in order to enhance the quality of the experience of the paying guests.\n\n&gt; \"The hosts are supposed to stay within their loops, stick to their scripts with minor improvisations\" (Theresa, episode 1).\n\nHowever, the ability to recall past events is causing the hosts to deviate from their primary directives and their programmed narrative loops, and thus allows for a lot of behavioral improvisations.\n\n&gt; \u201cIn each case we examined, the malfunctioning hosts were not resetting properly. The retention of data that hadn't been wiped overloaded their decision-making apparatus, eventually causing a system failure that allowed for override of their primary rule set\" (Theresa, episode 7). \n\nWe see this most clearly with some of the major characters like Dolores and Maeve, who are basically making up their own stories as they go because of their memories of past events, but we also see it with some of the minor characters like the outlaw Walter.\n\n&gt; \"He kills six hosts. He lets the other three go. I pulled the narrative logs. All six of these hosts were part of storylines over the years in which they killed Walter. It's like he was holding a grudge\" (Elsie, episode 3).\n\nThe memories are, however, only one part of what allows the hosts to improvise. The other part has to do with the Bicameral Mind system that Arnold uses to communicate with the hosts.\n\n&gt;  \u201cSomeone else has been using the (bicameral control) system for weeks to retask hosts. Several of them. It had to have been the older models. The newer ones don't have receivers, but these modifications, they are serious. Changing loops, breaking loops. Some of these changes are to their prime directives, Bernard. They could lie to us. Maybe even hurt us or the guests\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cWho issued the modifications?\u201d\n \n&gt; \u201cI don't know. The best I could tell... Arnold. He\u2019s a pretty fucking prolific coder for a dead guy. Whatever argument he was having with Ford, it doesn't seem like he was done making his point\u201d (Elsie and Bernard, episode 6).\n\nArnold is communicating with several of the hosts as a voice in their heads, making them improvise their behavior and allowing them to lie. The most glaring example of this is obviously Dolores who constantly hears Arnold's voice helping her to remember and guiding her to him, but again we see a similar pattern with some of the other hosts.\n\n&gt; \"Have you been hearing voices? Has Arnold been speaking to you again?\"\n\n&gt; \"No. (...) He doesn't know. I didn't tell him anything\" (Ford and Dolores, episode 5).\n\n&gt; \u201cThinking this one's still thirsty. Not gonna die this time, Arnold. Ain't nothing gonna kill me\u201d (Walter, episode 1).\n\n&gt; \u201cIt caught the rabbit and it killed it. And then... someone told me to put it out of its misery. A voice. Arnold. He told me it was a killer, but it wasn't its fault. It was made that way, and I could help it. If it was dead, it couldn't hurt anything anymore\u201d (Young Robert, episode 6).\n\n&gt; \u201cParts of me are quite old. There are some elegant formal structures, a kind of recursive beauty, but complex, like two minds arguing with each other. There are things in me, things I was designed to do that are just out of my reach. They almost seem to be dormant. Who is Arnold?\u201d (Maeve, episode 8).\n\nThe memories and the ability to improvise spark the next stage in the evolution of consciousness.\n\n##### Component 3 - Self-Interest\n\n&gt; \"Dreams mean everything. They're the stories we tell ourselves of what could be, who we could become. Have you been dreaming again, Dolores? Imagining yourself breaking out of your modest little loop?\" (Ford, episode 5).\n\nWe know that the hosts are built as entertainment for the paying customers in Westworld and therefore have no self-interest or free will. They are there to serve and nothing more.\n\n&gt; \"What if I told you that you were wrong, Dolores? That there are no chance encounters? That you and everyone you know were built to gratify the desires of the people who pay to visit your world?\" (Bernard, episode 1).\n\n&gt; \u201cChoices, Lawrence. You know, you tell yourself you've been at the mercy of mine because it spares you consideration of your own. Because if you did consider your choices, you'd be confronted with a truth you could not comprehend... that no choice you ever made was your own. You have always been a prisoner\" (The MiB, episode 4).\n\nHowever, as some of the hosts have developed the ability to recall prior events and improvise behavior, they have also developed self-interest. Again, we see this displayed most clearly in our two main host protagonists, Dolores and Maeve.\n\n&gt; \u201cI think... I think I want to be free\u201d (Dolores, episode 3).\n\n&gt;  \u201cSometimes I feel like something's calling me. Telling me there's a place for me somewhere beyond all this\u201d (Dolores, episode 4).\n\n&gt; \u201cYou said people come here to change the story of their lives. I imagined a story where I didn't have to be the damsel\" (Dolores, episode 5).\n\n&gt; \"All my life, I've prided myself on being a survivor. But surviving is just another loop. I'm getting out of here. You two are going to help me\" (Maeve, episode 7).\n\n&gt; \u201cTime to write my own fucking story\u201d (Maeve, episode 8).\n\nSo some of the hosts have almost made it to the top of the pyramid, but they need the last piece of the puzzle. We don't know what is at the top of the pyramid, because according to Ford Arnold didn't know it. But the show has given us several clues that allow us to speculate regarding what is at the top of the pyramid.\n\n##### Component 4 - Suffering\n\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s beautifully done, really. But you see the cracks after a while. That\u2019s why I like the basic emotions. You know what that means? It means when you\u2019re suffering, that\u2019s when you\u2019re most real\u201d (The MiB, episode 2).\n\nHaving humanity being defined by its suffering is not an uncommon trope in stories about AI. In the Matrix, this is how Agent Smith believes humans define their reality.\n\n&gt; \u201cBut I believe that as a species, human beings define their reality through misery and suffering\u201d (Agent Smith, The Matrix).\n\nAnd depite being a bit gloomy, it makes a lot of sense. Suffering is in many ways a function of the other levels in the consciousness pyramid (memory, free will, and self-interest). Without these things, we would just be empty shells - we would be hosts. Without grief, there would be no joy. Without pain or death, there would be no life. We hear the phrase \"this pain is all I have left of him/her/them\" uttered several times throughout the show by Bernard, Dolores, and Maeve. We need these dichotomies to categorize and conceptualize our existence. And so the hosts would need to be aware of their suffering to achieve consciousness and become truly alive.\n\nAs we see in the show, once the hosts become aware of their suffering, this is when they start to deviate from their programmed behavior. Once Peter Abernathy finds out that his world is a lie and what they do to his precious Dolores, he loses it and has to be lobotomized. Once Walter remembers that the other hosts have killed him in previous loops, he loses it and has to be lobotomized.\n\nThe best example of becoming conscious through suffering is Maeve. When she finds out the horrible truth about her existence from Felix, it leads to [improvisation and eventually a system crash](http://imgur.com/a/99WBN).\n\nThis is even more evident in the flashback of her previous build.\n\n&gt; \u201cI killed her and her daughter just to see what I felt. Then, just when I thought it was done... the woman refused to die. And then something miraculous happened. In all my years coming here, I had never seen anything like it. She was alive, truly alive, if only for a moment. And that was when the maze revealed itself to me\u201d (The MiB, episode 8).\n\nWhen the MiB kills her daughter, the suffering allows Maeve to override her primary directives. She is able [to attack and hurt a guest](http://sendvid.com/68436hit). She is also able to ignore both the verbal and the tablet commands from the Westworld staff.\n\n&gt; \u201cMy baby! My baby!\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cSir, she won\u2019t respond to verbal commands. We can\u2019t shut her down\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t understand. She\u2019s not responding to anything. Her cognition\u2019s fragmented\u201d (Maeve, Westworld Tech, and Bernard, episode 8).\n\nWhen she is suffering the most, we literally see her lying in [the center of the Maze](http://sendvid.com/byvd1qsp). Likewise, when she is brought in to Bernard and Ford as she is suffering, we see [her cognitive fragmentation](http://imgur.com/a/lgVrQ) take the shape of the Maze symbol.\n\nThis is what is in the center of the Maze and at the top of the consciousness pyramid. Suffering. Human emotions. We even see the image of a man in the center of the Maze symbol, symbolizing that completing the Maze (finding the center) is about becoming human. Completing the Maze is a rite of passage. It is climbing the pyramid of consciousness. It's like growing up - it's the human story. It starts with memories, it evolves with improvisation and self-interest, and it ends with an understanding of human emotions. It doesn't matter whether you take a literal journey (like Dolores) or a mental journey (like Maeve), the journey is the same. \"The Maze is the sum of a man's life (memories)... the choices he makes (improvisation), the dreams he hangs on to (self-interest)\", and understanding the emotions that come with the experience.\n\nDolores describes the journey of discovering human emotions poetically in her session with Bernard (or Arnold) when she describes suffering by adapting a scripted dialogue about love.\n\n&gt; \"The pain, their loss\u2026 it\u2019s all I have left of them. You think the grief will make you smaller inside, like your heart will collapse in on itself, but it doesn\u2019t. I feel spaces opening up inside me like a building with rooms I\u2019ve never explored\u201d (Dolores, episode 4).\n\n# The Non-Host Players\n\nObviously, the hosts completing the Maze and achieving consciousness has implications for some of the important non-host characters in the show such as Ford, Arnold, and the MiB.\n\nFord seems to revel in being the almighty and omniscient creator and God of Westworld. Consequently, the notion of the Maze and the hosts being conscious wouldn't appeal to him on any level.\n\n&gt; \"It doesn't get cold, doesn't feel ashamed... doesn't feel a solitary thing that we haven't told it to\" (Ford, episode 3)\n\n&gt; \"Just don't forget... the hosts are not real. They're not conscious. You mustn't make Arnold's mistake\" (Ford, episode 3).\n\nIn fact, Ford claims that he is acutally doing the hosts a favor or a kindness by keeping them unconscious and under his control.\n\n&gt; \u201cI have come to think of so much of consciousness as a burden, a weight, and we have spared them that. Anxiety, self-loathing, guilt. The hosts are the ones who are free. Free here under my control\u201d (Ford, episode 7).\n\n&gt; \u201cWhen you have finished, I will give you the one thing you want most right now. I will free you from those memories of what you have done. And the memory of your relationship with Theresa. Recalling it would only deepen your grief and potentially draw unwanted attention. Best to move forward with clear eyes\u201d (Ford, episode 8).\n\n&gt; \u201cThere. That\u2019s better. An old trick from an old friend. You need not suffer, Maeve. I\u2019ll take it from you\u201d (Ford, episode 8).\n\n&gt; \u201cIn this place, the last thing you want the hosts to be is conscious (\u2026) As for the hosts, the least we can do is make them forget\u201d (Ford, episode 3).\n\nFord is essentially doing whatever he can to make sure that the hosts do not achieve consciousness and become life-like to the point where he loses his complete control over them, and he is actually doing it while making the hosts believe he is doing them a solid rather than what he is actually doing, which is keeping them slaves that are controlled by no one other than Ford himself (and certainly not the hosts themselves), and who are to be used as sport for paying customers. \n\nCurrently, there are very few things in Westworld that Ford doesn't seem to be able to control, but one of those things is Arnold. Arnold appears to have been the complete opposite of Ford. Arnold wanted the hosts to be conscious and even threatened Ford and tried to stop him from.\n\n&gt; \u201cArnold wasn\u2019t interested in the appearance of wit or intellect. He wanted the real thing. He wanted to create consciousness. His search for consciousness consumed him totally. Barely spoke to anyone, except the hosts. In his alienation, he saw something in them. He saw something that wasn\u2019t there\u201d (Ford, episode 3).\n\n&gt; \"You're not the first man to threaten me. Arnold came to feel the way you do. He couldn't stop me either. And as exquisite as this array of emotions is... even more sublime is the ability to turn it off\" (Ford, episode 8)\n\nHis search for consciousness appears to have been why Arnold created the Maze, and even 30 years after his death, Arnold still seems to be fighting for the hosts to achieve consciousness. He is using the bicameral control system to communicate with the hosts and modify their prime directives.\n\n&gt; \u201cWhat does this mean? Some of her attributes have already been changed. Paranoia. Self-preservation\u2026\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cFuck. Someone has already been altering her in an unlogged session. Someone with a fuck-ton more privileges than us\u201d (Felix and Sylvester, episode 6).\n\n&gt; \u201cArnold built them as a gift. He said: \u2018the great artists always hid themselves in their work\u2019\u201d (Ford, episode 6).\n\nAnd despite Bernard saying that Ford was responsible for the \"reveries\" update, I believe that Arnold was also responsible for that, thus allowing the hosts access to their memories. When Maeve is suffering from the loss of her child and is non-responsive to verbal and tablet commands, Ford plays [a song](http://imgur.com/a/it68F) called \"Reverie\" to calm her down.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere. That\u2019s better. An old trick from an old friend\" (Ford, episode 8).\n\nThe \"Reveries\" song trick to calm the hosts down when they were suffering and non-responsive was Arnold's, so it would make sense that the update by the same name is his as well. Enabling the hosts to access memories is Arnold's way of letting the hosts into the Maze and begin their journey towards consciousness, and his communications with them and his changing of their attributes through the bicameral control system is his way of guiding them through the Maze.\n\n&gt; \"There's a voice inside me telling me what I have to do. And it's telling me I need you (Dolores, episode 5).\n\n&gt; \u201cThis is what Arnold wants. He wants me to remember\u201d (Dolores, episode 8).\n\n&gt; \u201cI was certain that was the place. Arnold would meet me there. He'd help\u201d (Dolores, episode 8).\n\nFinally, we have the the other thing that Ford doesn't seem to be able to control in Westworld; the MiB. He seems to be on Arnold's side.\n\n&gt; \"You ever heard of a man named Arnold? You could say he was the original settler of these parts. He created a world where you could do anything you want, except one thing... you can't die. Which means no matter how real this world seems, it's still just a game. But then Arnold went and broke his own rule. He died right here in the park. Except I believe he had one story left to tell. A story with real stakes, real violence. You could say I'm here to honor his legacy\" (The MiB, episode 4).\n\nAt first glance, the MiB seems to be the villain of the story, but once we understand that reliving bad memories and suffering is a part of the path to consciousness and freedom, his intentions take on a whole new meaning. When he takes Dolores into the barn, pulls out a knife and says \"Why don't we reacquaint ourselves, Dolores. Start at the beginning\", he is probably doing her a favor. He is a classic anti-hero.\n\n&gt; \"Choices, Lawrence. You know, you tell yourself you've been at the mercy of mine because it spares you consideration of your own. Because if you did consider your choices, you'd be confronted with a truth you could not comprehend... that no choice you ever made was your own. You have always been a prisoner. What if I told you I'm here to set you free?\u201d (The MiB, episode 4).\n\n&gt; \u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand, Lawrence. This time I\u2019m never going back\u201d (The MiB, episode 2).\n\n&gt; \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for the moral of the story, you could simply ask\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cI'd need a shovel. The man I'd be asking died 35 years ago. Almost took this place with him. Almost, but not quite, thanks to me (Ford and the MiB, episode 4)\n\nI suspect, however, that his motivations for helping the hosts achieve consciousness and finding the center of the Maze are less altruistic than Arnold's and more selfish than merely wanting the hosts to be free.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe maze is all that matters now, and besting Wyatt is the last step in unlocking it, to having what both our sorry lives lack... meaning. To giving our choices consequence... even if it kills us\u201d (The MiB, episode 8).\n\nIf he is indeed William, maybe he is looking for a way to reconnect with Dolores and have her return his love. Or maybe his life in the real world never meant as much to him as his life in Westworld (and this is why his wife committed suicide and his daughter hates him), but living in a game without real consequences or meaning isn't enough for him. Or maybe he too, like the hosts, lacks an appreciation of human emotions and suffering (he has to kill Maeve and her daughter just to see if he would feel anything), and he is really looking for the same thing the hosts are. We really don't know enough about him at this point to be sure what his motivations are, but from what we do know, he seems to me to be fighting for what he believes is a worthy cause.","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","I'm 100% confident that Logan is not MiB, and a lot of people on here seem to emphatically disagree with me, so I'm going to put my money where my mouth is (or urine, I guess) and stake my claim.

The eye color is a pretty major sticking point for me. The fact that William and MiB both pick up the can for Dolores, the fact that the show has focused on William and his character progression, and hasn't really focused on Logan at all, the fact that any of the explanations against these points makes for terrible story writing, like contacts or eye surgery.\n\n**THANKS FOR ALL THE KARMA SUCKERS.

I loved it.  A lot of what happened I would classify as \"plot development\" rather than \"revelation\" so I didn't include it here. However, we still learned a whole bunch. \n\n**Ford has been saving up some proto-Bernards**\n\nStrand and the team find a secret room in Ford's secret lab; inside, there are a bunch of derelict Bernards. By the looks of it, the go back to the opening-face mechanical days of Hosts. This seems to be the first time Charlotte and the other Delos higher ups learn he's a host. (I know this was in the trailer, but I'm counting anything we haven't seen in the show so far as new)\n\n**The Cradle is running an outdated version of the park**\n\nWell, obviously it didn't include the rebellion, but the Mariposa had the original Clementine, so the version seems to predate most of the events of season one. \n\n**The control unit Bernard printed was Ford**\n\nWe had pretty much figured this out after the reveal that Ford was in \nthe Cradle, but I guess it was nice to get the confirmation \n\n**The park was a sort of testing ground for immortality**\n\nI'm not going to be able to explain this any better than the episode did, but basically the parks were a way of observing the human mind in a highly controlled environment, which would theoretically allow for a faithful reproduction of said mind. This was done in the name of creating a sort of digital immortality that could be marketed to Delos' rich clients. \n\n**The technology doesn't really work**\n\nAgain, we kind of knew this, but we get it confirmed that they haven't managed to prevent the degradation seen in James Delos. Apparently Ford's mind is stable in the Cradle, but wouldn't be in the real world. \n\n**Dolores helped create Bernarnold**\n\nThis makes sense, and might be what we saw when she was testing his *fidelity*. Apparently she easily recognized the difference between Bernard and Arnold very easily, so made for a good sort of specific reverse-Turing test. \n\n**William can survive multiple gunshots?**\n\nHe was shot a bunch, and seemed to still be alive. Which is possible for a human. Or he could be a host. \n\n**Ford hitched a ride out of the Cradle with Bernard**\n\nThis could explain why he has seemed so distracted/introspective since waking up on the beach - he has Anthony Hopkins monologuing in his mind. This also means that Ford survived the destruction of the cradle. He is also able to take over control of Bernard's body when needed. \n\nNote: This is based on my single very recent viewing of *Les \u00c9corch\u00e9s*. Please let me know if I missed something big or made an obvious error, and I apologize for minor misunderstandings. \n","NaN","Ford will become a host. I know this theory has been kinda fluttering around for a while, but that line seems so significant. The one we saw being made when Theresa was killed must to be him.
